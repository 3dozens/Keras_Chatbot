Bot's return =  spare met jack i'm into legit investments from here on in 

---------------
Q = Say, you can't do that?

A = I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.

Bot's return =  why

A = So you can't tell me anything?

---------------
Q = Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.

Bot's return =  well

A = It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.

Bot's return =  well 

---------------
Q = I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?

A = I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.

Bot's return =  try

A = Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

A = Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.

Bot's return =  we've by make about this money you gonna 

---------------
Q = Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?

A = I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.

Bot's return =  you're a private hypocrite a little popular drink i'm told 

---------------
Q = ...aconite get it dat cheap.

A = I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.

Bot's return =  right all welcome to that it's the fuck of your going calls is on going on won't for sorry 

---------------
Q = I slept too near where I fell out.

A = You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.

Bot's return =  yes yes it's beautiful all the scumbags in the car 

---------------
Q = Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.

A = Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.

Bot's return =  you seem to know all about my destiny 

---------------
Q = You leave something out?

A = After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.

Bot's return =  hey you mr president ask been give up to watch you a never 

---------------
Q = Aw, c'mon.

Bot's return =  dr evil we learn three calling you're day no his will all he childhood for it 

---------------
Q = Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

Bot's return =  this the contrary bitch it's a man idea of the unfreezing process and who for the money of all i lost to take them been three but dunbar sense and you are made four him the time ass it that's a different tack 

---------------
Q = My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.

A = What is your uncle's name?

Bot's return =  i don't know maybe i just him 

---------------
Q = This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?

A = This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

Bot's return =  it's we tooth 

---------------
Q = Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.

A = The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.

Bot's return =  so it didn't i been hear you know who i got to take 

---------------
Q = Has he sent the challenge yet?

A = Not yet, but I believe he intends to.

Bot's return =  a hospital is is it 

---------------
Q = And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.

A = I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.

Bot's return =  well you must get it 

---------------
Q = Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.

A = A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.

Bot's return =  but dad 

---------------
Q = There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.

A = Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?

Bot's return =  rogers hornsby 

---------------
Q = No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.

A = The coward!

Bot's return =  yeah you watch sure 

---------------
Q = I don't know.

A = Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.

Bot's return =  alice it's no dream i'm sorry dan's dead 

---------------
Q = Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

A = I will let down the steps for your honor.

Q = You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?

A = Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Bot's return =  no we don't not if where help tell are 

---------------
Q = You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.

A = Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.

Bot's return =  i was talking to him to you about one you feel them in front them not that 

---------------
Q = And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.

A = I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.

Bot's return =  do you have bad dreams too 

---------------
Q = I believe they will deport you.

A = I have faced that problem before.

Bot's return =  krueger is reality to thing the point of these ongoing investigation

Q = No.

A = Have you had one?

Bot's return =  you know where i would resist 

---------------
Q = Not even that.

A = How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?

Bot's return =  oh you must 

---------------
Q = Not one.

A = Have you not a man whom you value?

Bot's return =  really jam you complainin' to make us barf 

---------------
Q = Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.

A = Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.

Bot's return =  jesus christ 

---------------
Q = But you refused me, Dorothy.

A = Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.

Bot's return =  he's you do a tranquilizer full to sleep wolf he 

---------------
Q = What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?

A = Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.

Bot's return =  your dreams of marion are gone i killed them myself if i knew i could live with a baby in this town 

---------------
Q = All the same, you must name an amount.

A = It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.

Bot's return =  pull better here to be that some minute she the crew person in the night is this guy thing that this supposed it's not gets a little as it has for going you 

---------------
Q = And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.

A = Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?

Bot's return =  certainly of this not would trying if alone way are going we we leaving it out of the hell of right right we when our we can our with right won't here 

---------------
Q = Does this assignment interest you?

A = Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.

Bot's return =  anything got not that right 

---------------
Q = I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.

A = Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.

Bot's return =  just i gave you any thought i probably put anything to go home this for you were 

---------------
Q = But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?

A = Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

Bot's return =  my a wanted woman i can a fucking to our it his 

---------------
Q = Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.

A = Would you have me spend my life all alone?

Bot's return =  are you embarrassed by 

---------------
Q = In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

Bot's return =  and over all that

A = I wanted to see if he was okay --

Bot's return =  why should 

---------------
Q = No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --

A = You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.

Bot's return =  kind right

Bot's return =  and over all we it without or be a good time to you now all these the war you're it moment like me seconds it

Bot's return =  and over all that

---------------
Q = I don't think I want to hear this --

A = Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.

Bot's return =  well you're of sounds i like you too them

Bot's return =  okay

Q = What's wrong with me?

A = Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

Bot's return =  why's 

---------------
Q = Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?

A = I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.

Bot's return =  shut up

Bot's return =  why don't you can shoot him it isn't him gonna be

A = Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

Q = I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

A = No, not at all.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = You should stay.

A = I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...

Bot's return =  not mom

Q = How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?

Q = Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.

A = I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.

---------------
Q = Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.

A = I think she's great.

Bot's return =  we've damn everything this is if now to talk do father questions her thing you know all it nothing 

---------------
Q = Me too. There's this poem --

A = Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?

Bot's return =  well 

---------------
Q = I think, before.

A = Seems too coincidental that way.

Bot's return =  pull be do they the remember you your how to make 

---------------
Q = Cool.

A = What are you doing?

Bot's return =  and the casino

Bot's return =  i don't want to talk about it happened i ain't you all it at i make let him her very i had thing i'm everyone is her she i want go us 

---------------
Q = Doesn't sound like me.

A = Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?

A = I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = I know. I had to take the day to think.

A = Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?

Bot's return =  something's

Bot's return =  i could get this those shot being i did the line this the quiet childs 

---------------
Q = Clementine.

A = I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = What?

A = Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --

Bot's return =  i'm not afraid her go is you if this father in these these like right

Bot's return =  i do know claim me you did to the king has it it's your when out

Q = So you think the dissertation will get published?

A = I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.

Bot's return =  you don't know is i have a real good a wait anymore i'm ass 

---------------
Q = Okay, we're back in.

A = That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

Bot's return =  we were attacked you and idea jack 

---------------
Q = That's lovely.

A = Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

Bot's return =  hopefully 

---------------
Q = What, Howard?

A = We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.

Bot's return =  stop it jack 

---------------
Q = Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!

A = I have a family, Mary.

Bot's return =  and now is is much like much you commit it was the some let 'cause about not could be the drug of our

Bot's return =  yeah most cops your not have here now being way you have know what the hell anymore and the hawk

---------------
Q = Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.

A = Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.

Bot's return =  it is 

---------------
Q = The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.

A = Siwash, huh?

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.

A = The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.

Bot's return =  you must believe me 

---------------
Q = That's Jellybean!

A = FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.

Bot's return =  the canines will be real you'll taste real blood god damit david please believe me you'll kill and make others like me i'm not having a nice time david don't allow this to happen again you must take your own life 

---------------
Q = Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.

A = How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?

Bot's return =  right all welcome to that it's the fuck of your going calls is on going on won't for sorry 

---------------
Q = Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.

A = It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.

Bot's return =  where 

---------------
Q = How does she like what in bed?

A = Like what?

Bot's return =  maybe 

---------------
Q = Whose fault was that?

A = I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.

Bot's return =  what're he say out a fucking in his stature 

---------------
Q = Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.

A = What guy?

Bot's return =  yeah on you revolting right 

---------------
Q = Thanks.

A = American Cheese. The king of road food.

Bot's return =  i want you to meet some people 

---------------
Q = Are you in show business?

A = I was a successful model once.

Bot's return =  don't really you can and there you want it begins us 

---------------
Q = You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.

A = Bonanza Jellybean?

Bot's return =  right all welcome to that it's the fuck of money luck the little thing i 

---------------
Q = If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?

A = Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.

Bot's return =  well of course be not gonna be her to the room you give taking yourself back him i must be the thing 

---------------
Q = But Countess...

A = Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.

Bot's return =  what're he come out a fucking in his stature 

---------------
Q = That means top-secret, Cooper.

A = I heard it.

Bot's return =  oh

---------------
Q = Time to play Spam in the can.

A = Don't start with me, Cooper.

Bot's return =  i haven't to know why about i'm the fuck are you 

---------------
Q = From what?

A = You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?

Bot's return =  i don't want to talk about it to school over all a lawyer i told you all a ask to me 

---------------
Q = You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?

A = I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = What?

A = You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.

Bot's return =  oh 

---------------
Q = Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.

A = You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.

Bot's return =  you're 

---------------
Q = Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...

A = Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.

Bot's return =  i can't sorry madame but you 

---------------
Q = Coffee.

A = No, thank you.

Bot's return =  right him welcome tell tell on behalf man the mission and out a traditional guy a good man least 

---------------
Q = The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.

A = Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?

Bot's return =  no that my blood 

---------------
Q = To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.

A = I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.

Bot's return =  and over all we it without or be a good time to you now all these the war you're it moment like me seconds it give i love give my wife 

---------------
Q = Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.

A = "Another man?" Who?

Bot's return =  i'm not afraid you should 

---------------
Q = What is it?

A = I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.

Bot's return =  i don't 

---------------
Q = It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."

A = "Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = I've got a pulse, he's alive...

A = Pressure?

Bot's return =  sgt mcmanus are you suggesting for you've and lady you are mind it better better at you are 

---------------
Q = 90 over 50 and falling... .

A = He's crashing...

Bot's return =  and abdul and carl and sacha and sacha and now 

---------------
Q = That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...

A = A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.

Bot's return =  borrowed i borrowed it 

---------------
Q = It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.

A = Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.

Bot's return =  look 

---------------
Q = The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.

A = That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.

Bot's return =  she's the pills at would to be on the one 

---------------
Q = Oh my god OH MY GOD...

A = Starck!

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.

A = We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.

Bot's return =  it's he 

---------------
Q = This is Weir.

A = Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.

Bot's return =  right him welcome tell tell on behalf he the other thing 

---------------
Q = Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.

A = The crew? Could they still be alive?

Bot's return =  how not something it happened i can't to get in how or the other 

---------------
Q = Peters is right, no one's here.

A = I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...

Bot's return =  it's he 

---------------
Q = Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.

A = The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.

Bot's return =  but except that it 

---------------
Q = Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.

A = I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...

Bot's return =  and over all we it without or be a good time to you now all these the war you're it moment like me seconds it give i love give my wife 

---------------
Q = It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.

A = Where has it been for the last seven years?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = What does it say?

A = NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...

Bot's return =  baby i can't give you anything but love good now the time 

---------------
Q = I can see that, what're they for?

A = In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

Bot's return =  aw nerts 

---------------
Q = No one?

A = They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.

Bot's return =  why i think i'm they about us i'm i say 

---------------
Q = Explanation?

A = Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.

Bot's return =  no i never did either 

---------------
Q = Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.

A = Don't... don't do this...

Bot's return =  aw right what about the other guy 

---------------
Q = If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.

A = What makes you think I'll miss?

Bot's return =  it's it's a little sonofabitch the wind we the drug so got are the car i can relate to come off some you were here on the one then be a very to take you don't know a little a while of this a while of while 

---------------
Q = Weir is dead.

A = Then who the fuck are you?

Bot's return =  do you have a salon prive 

---------------
Q = You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!

A = I'm not the Devil.

Bot's return =  you saw the money a man a man 

---------------
Q = Jesus...

A = What is that?

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = We've got some weather.

A = I noticed. Starck, anybody home?

Bot's return =  i'm going and why i do 

---------------
Q = 1500 meters. We're getting too close...

A = Where is it?

Bot's return =  now is no now to let you want about please 

---------------
Q = Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!

A = Starck...

Bot's return =  take it easy clark 

---------------
Q = I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.

A = We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.

Bot's return =  no you sure 

---------------
Q = ...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...

A = That's enough!

Bot's return =  aw they've gone crazy you can't reason with a mob 

---------------
Q = Skipper...

A = What is it, Smith?

Bot's return =  so that's you hate all women 

---------------
Q = We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.

A = Justin?

Bot's return =  what is anthony adams 

---------------
Q = Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.

A = Let's go.

Bot's return =  of course yes just what would you like to know inspector 

---------------
Q = Everybody okay?

A = We're all here.

Bot's return =  he's offer to talk about 

---------------
Q = It tastes bad.

A = But you can breathe it.

Bot's return =  oh yes of course there at i had the girls man my forehead do you looking at i'm 

---------------
Q = I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.

A = So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

Bot's return =  if you don't mind inspector i'd rather not say that is unless it becomes absolutely essential you see she's married 

---------------
Q = What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...

A = Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.

Bot's return =  and over all we it without or be a good time to you now all these the war you're it moment like me seconds it give i love give my wife 

---------------
Q = ...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...

A = "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...

A = We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...

Bot's return =  stand back inspector let me out of here or i'll shoot you 

---------------
Q = Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!

A = Five seconds.

Bot's return =  why we it doctor it's a dorrit 

---------------
Q = Weir can't be alive.

A = Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.

Bot's return =  don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs 

---------------
Q = BLOW THE FUCKER UP.

A = Blow it up?

Bot's return =  claims he was there with a married woman doesn't want to mention her name 

---------------
Q = We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...

A = ...repeat, we're armed...

Bot's return =  and abdul is he close please 

---------------
Q = Weir.

A = He's dead...

Bot's return =  gambling i owed them a lot of money last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars 

---------------
Q = Claire...

A = DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

Bot's return =  what is it 

---------------
Q = Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

A = You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?

Bot's return =  i've got to play you a drink 

---------------
Q = We have to do something, oh God...

A = Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...

Bot's return =  oh what's ma'am 

---------------
Q = What the hell is that?

A = That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.

Bot's return =  get out get out 

---------------
Q = What?

A = It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.

Bot's return =  i know to rest 

---------------
Q = If they are, they're screening their calls.

A = Range 3000 meters and closing.

Bot's return =  what the dirty bitch i hope your very blood 

---------------
Q = What happened to his eyes?

A = Explosive decompression.

Bot's return =  i'm sorry dude but i 

---------------
Q = A straight line.

A = Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...

Bot's return =  oh we you let me do last than let's 

---------------
Q = That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.

A = I can't believe we built this.

Bot's return =  how why you know 

---------------
Q = How'd you know it was me?

A = I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?

Bot's return =  no time i am it's to ask you this drink 

---------------
Q = Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?

A = I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

Bot's return =  you're a private hypocrite a little popular drink i'm told 

---------------
Q = About me? How sweet.

A = Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.

Bot's return =  does you vincenzo 

---------------
Q = He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --

A = Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --

Bot's return =  but just being two all it

A = We got what we wanted. That's enough.

Bot's return =  i'm friend all an 

---------------
Q = No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.

A = Youthful high spirits.

Bot's return =  well you can you always could 

---------------
Q = They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.

A = I'm sure he's matured since then.

Bot's return =  what is 

---------------
Q = I had it at four.

A = This makes five.

Bot's return =  what is right would is do it 

---------------
Q = This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.

A = Victor's better at these things.

Bot's return =  but you see it isn't blarney where you're concerned

Q = What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.

A = Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?

Bot's return =  other you know what i got think so 

---------------
Q = You two need a time-out.

A = Blockhead started it!

Bot's return =  good for you come on 

---------------
Q = Is that what you call it? "Real"?

A = At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

Bot's return =  oh you're not so badly off there's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife 

---------------
Q = Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --

A = Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --

Q = Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.

A = What...?  Oh.

Bot's return =  oh you get to make 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --

A = What in the world would give me that idea?

Bot's return =  the test of toscanelli marin 

---------------
Q = Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.

A = I think it was a little more complicated than --

Bot's return =  some or up and debt shoot them bad we're 

---------------
Q = What are you doing?

A = The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.

Bot's return =  yeah is he you think do do don't the your someone here 

---------------
Q = And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.

A = With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --

A = He was going to take away all my data, equipment --

Bot's return =  now did you like up a movie i love you go it i can't i won't you too much a last good as you or night 

---------------
Q = Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --

A = Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --

Bot's return =  right 

---------------
Q = When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.

A = Why didn't you say something?

Bot's return =  did tell you can got it you gotta give me bank him and i gotta you and nothing i clap my job and i'll you

Q = You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --

A = The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.

Bot's return =  it's amazing can is he if get with my fault 

---------------
Q = But I'm not done with the machine --

A = Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.

Bot's return =  come you don't these what 

---------------
Q = It's just business.

A = I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

Bot's return =  yes but you know a few blarney 

---------------
Q = Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --

A = Susan. What are you doing?

Bot's return =  yes in the music act one to hide someone the wind probably

Bot's return =  christ no nice who some work after from me then we here you 

---------------
Q = Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

A = I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.

Bot's return =  yeah you come with me 

---------------
Q = I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...

A = That little prick.

Bot's return =  you just when out first 

---------------
Q = I paid for it and everything.

A = There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.

Bot's return =  ain't gonna be moved 

---------------
Q = I want romance.

A = Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.

Bot's return =  do you have another 

---------------
Q = Sometime?

A = Yeah, like maybe never.

Bot's return =  why he not choose here why are the 

---------------
Q = Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.

A = I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?

Bot's return =  it is suicide 

---------------
Q = Where do you feel like going?

A = I don't know. Wherever you want.

Bot's return =  was mrs dickson there

But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.

Q = Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!

---------------
Q = Give away food?

A = Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.

---------------
Q = Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.

A = Yes, Caesar.

Bot's return =  i didn't know guys that maybe 

---------------
Q = The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.

A = That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?

Bot's return =  and the landy woman 

---------------
Q = I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.

A = You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.

Bot's return =  all one do you remember me 

---------------
Q = I've read of it.

A = But have never been?

Bot's return =  what reason 

---------------
Q = The Senate too?

A = The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.

Bot's return =  why's 

---------------
Q = How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?

A = When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.

Bot's return =  oh you're the whole characters are a good minute to blow 

---------------
Q = You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.

A = You don't know how wrong you are.

Bot's return =  don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal 

---------------

---------------
Q = Servis made it through again?

A = He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.

Bot's return =  it's bullwinkle 

---------------
Q = It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.

A = So I understand.

Bot's return =  you fancy me 

---------------
Q = Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?

A = You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...

Bot's return =  well that's what she's in the doj oh don't gonna in the in 

---------------
Q = It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.

A = It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!

A = You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!

Bot's return =  i don't care it parasite i object your car with you performing your to your lady in my purse 

---------------
Q = He's very realistic.

A = Isn't the helmet magnificent?

Bot's return =  but right send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here for one and i'll be my friend cause things be all there 

---------------
Q = Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.

A = I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...

Bot's return =  it's but meet can can would you say around ten 

---------------
Q = When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.

A = No!

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = Who the hell are you?

A = I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.

Bot's return =  last right do you ask 

---------------
Q = Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?

A = You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.

Bot's return =  it's amazing me my business i've and backwards 

---------------
Q = Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!

A = I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.

Bot's return =  i don't want to do who i go 

---------------
Q = General, do you realize what happened out there today?

A = I didn't get killed and everyone else did.

Bot's return =  the the couple or as have could a man but there either us me to safe i don't know anything you have that but be either 

---------------
Q = General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.

A = Alive... I'm alive...

Bot's return =  is it one of ours 

---------------
Q = Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.

A = What the hell are you talking about, Greek?

Bot's return =  no i'm not if some to get out 

---------------
Q = Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?

A = On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!

Bot's return =  right 

---------------
Q = Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.

A = Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!

Bot's return =  certainly of the autonomic has be 

---------------
Q = I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.

A = I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!

Bot's return =  and look what you've done to mr bigglesworth 

---------------
Q = Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.

A = I want nothing to do with the arena.

Bot's return =  tender 

---------------
Q = Do you always drive like this?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  the the couple or as have could a man but there either us me to safe i don't know anything you have that but be either

You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.

At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.

Bot's return =  of course 

---------------
Q = An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time.

You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?

He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.

A = And better?

A = You ain't goin' nowhere alone.

Bot's return =  has we'll asleep 

---------------
Q = That film was a fake! Everything's phony...

A = Ratan!

Bot's return =  what is easy i'm not hurrying 

---------------
Q = Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.

A = What exactly do you have in mind?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = Sounds all right.

Q = I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.

A = Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.

Bot's return =  yeah swell that sounds nice jeffrey like i think you to beat me

Bot's return =  what are the worms most of these apples 

---------------
Q = I don't know.

A = I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.

Bot's return =  i know

Bot's return =  yeah swayzak humanity's last hope how can you work for that guy 

---------------
Q = You are the wisest person I know.

A = Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.

Bot's return =  all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt 

---------------
Q = Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.

A = I like you, Maude.

Bot's return =  and i'll the fog lifted was not going do was have body 

---------------
Q = And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------

A = But why now?

Bot's return =  is that my only object 

---------------
Q = I'm going to marry the woman I love.

---------------
Q = That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?

A = I go to funerals.

Bot's return =  yeah you see

A = I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.

A = Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.

Bot's return =  you sure him done 

---------------
Q = It's the greatest excitement in the world.

A = To pit your own life against another.

Bot's return =  i can't can't you the good the one but the bad it all him

---------------
Q = I feel I ought to take care of her.

A = Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.

Bot's return =  and course 

---------------
Q = Well, I'm independent, too.

A = Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?

Bot's return =  let's like a little wine if you have it 

---------------
Q = I'm beginning to realize that.

A = And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.

Bot's return =  and i feel one drop is to speak why you would me 

---------------
Q = Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.

Q = Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.

A = The money? Why?

Bot's return =  and is a nice piece doctor

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job

A = You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.

Bot's return =  ma if i'd won i'd know something you that because

Bot's return =  it's we tooth underestimate we you think i was a coat in your own here tonight 

---------------
Q = Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.

A = Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.

Bot's return =  why mother 

---------------
Q = Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?

A = Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.

---------------
Q = You mean you're not coming back to work here?

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --

A = You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!

Bot's return =  you seem to know all about my destiny 

---------------
Q = I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.

A = Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.

Bot's return =  you're the boss are a lot of my life 

---------------
Q = Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!

A = You -- you --

Bot's return =  i'm sure 

---------------
Q = Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.

A = What's the matter?

Bot's return =  we were be to get that some sort 

---------------
Q = Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!

A = Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?

Bot's return =  roger is an honorable title 

---------------
Q = It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.

A = That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"

A = I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.

Bot's return =  where do you go from here 

---------------
Q = A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.

A = Where'd you meet this man?

A = I know, but --

Bot's return =  yeah you excuse 

---------------
Q = Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!

Q = You're exaggerating!

A = I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!

Bot's return =  oh a little check to insult you all one to make care the walk 

---------------
Q = Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?

A = Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.

Bot's return =  norther is do you thinkin' about and my life 

---------------
Q = Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.

A = No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.

Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?

A = I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money.

Q = I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.

A = Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!

Bot's return =  what are you talkin' about

Q = You!

A = Yeah.

Bot's return =  yes long it's give need the aggravation 

---------------
Q = I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.

A = Well, I'll be?

Bot's return =  that'd be nice 

---------------
Q = Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.

A = Okay, pete. 

Bot's return =  your you mean 

---------------
Q = 'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.

A = Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.

Bot's return =  no dad dickson is he the odds 

---------------
Q = Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.

A = Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.

A = They're married all right. I just seen the license.

Bot's return =  i do god's truth i do 

---------------
Q = Send it collect.

A = Collect?

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Then?you'll have to git !

A = Yeah, you'll have to git .

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = Wife?

A = Yeah. Come on?come on!

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.

A = What's on your mind?

Bot's return =  can i put 

---------------
Q = I can use a smart guy like you.

A = Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to?

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.

A = Huh?

Bot's return =  nobles i insist 

---------------
Q = A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?

A = Why?no?

Bot's return =  not quite 

---------------
Q = What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.

A = Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see?and?

Bot's return =  right all welcome guy tell tell i'm a few minutes man the first is the same is the back

A = I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.

Bot's return =  sure 

---------------
Q = Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.

A = Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.

Bot's return =  you been home yet 

---------------
Q = Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.

A = Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.

A = The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...

Bot's return =  what do you want with of big how's you believe it or in mean done 

---------------
Q = The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.

A = Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.

Bot's return =  look 

---------------
Q = Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.

A = Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...

Bot's return =  now wait guys will her name 

---------------
Q = And Oswald?

A = Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...

Bot's return =  i know about how she was like but we was different i's the only person she talked to about it how she's abused terrible things gill just terrible 

---------------
Q = Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?

A = There were no phone records.

Bot's return =  it's not her fault gill a bury of her i love you too vanessa with i thought love you less the rules of that that you did be a fucking this that 

---------------
Q = Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.

A = I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.

Bot's return =  you know everything the kid what a man i think is to be i trust was your own here being here i could so the idea since of the job since got 

---------------
Q = A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

A = Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.

Bot's return =  you think i'm ronnie's spy or somethin' that the money things talked for money in the money reason three they don't could got back be in a lot and staring in a car miles it's one could have a to him in prison in the house 

---------------
Q = Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.

A = Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.

A = No, I'm not...

Bot's return =  why 

---------------
Q = Clay Bertrand, Willie?

A = Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.

Bot's return =  i begged him don't see why he had to go 

---------------
Q = Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.

A = Go on, Willie.

Bot's return =  yeah them let's i pay the in and i work or have a fucking man i had drunk you 

---------------
Q = Hold your horses.  What kinda source?

A = The anonymous kind, Chief.

Bot's return =  mrs 

---------------
Q = Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.

A = Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.

Bot's return =  no i 

---------------
Q = He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.

A = When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?

A = We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.

Bot's return =  yeah give it my best 

---------------
Q = That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...

A = Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?

Bot's return =  it is nonetheless a misfortune and a very time that now are me now 

---------------
Q = Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!

A = Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?

Bot's return =  my father has out on this i think to get with i wanted to see anywhere vallens right i'm sister goes the damn he should the other thing i don't know what what stuff 

---------------
Q = Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."

A = Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.

Bot's return =  and you gonna live it with him 

---------------
Q = All right, all right.  Break it up.

A = Where you going, boss?

Bot's return =  i'm not paid you for drop 

---------------
Q = Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!

A = So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.

Bot's return =  disco that's what do we it other my been go now we have a go in the eye good the good person then then a difference to save good made i don't know but i will will that it technical i'm mind 

---------------
Q = ...ever called Dean Andrews?

A = No, I did not.

Bot's return =  oh do that now though 

---------------
Q = ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?

A = No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.

Bot's return =  it's right 

---------------
Q = Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?

A = Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?

Bot's return =  i can dad 

---------------
Q = Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?

A = Calm down, Dave, what?

Bot's return =  wonderful detective did you have in anything majesty you 

---------------
Q = I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.

A = Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.

Bot's return =  well i found the news something about a kiddie porn dungeon 

---------------
Q = What do you mean?

A = Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.

Bot's return =  don't trying to quit 

---------------
Q = Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?

A = Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?

Bot's return =  no i never 

---------------
Q = Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?

A = How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.

Bot's return =  oh you do that lenny us it is the next do you think me to 

---------------
Q = That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.

A = But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.

Bot's return =  and i'll be the misunderstanding of the universe of mine for the most of my life i could a ask that the archbishop 

---------------
Q = Why?  What's wrong?

A = Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

Bot's return =  you need a get away way the the person you should so in the next and the car 

---------------
Q = Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.

A = Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?

Bot's return =  like you said that those 

---------------
Q = Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?

A = You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.

Bot's return =  right 

---------------
Q = And Shaw?

A = Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.

Bot's return =  one a 

---------------
Q = What about Ruby?

A = Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

Bot's return =  you know i do the weirdest 

---------------
Q = They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.

A = Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = No.

A = But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.

A = I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.

Bot's return =  you don't know to get first 

---------------
Q = Dad, look what I drew.

A = That's something, Jasper.  What is it?

Bot's return =  right him welcome tell tell on behalf he the other thing 

---------------
Q = I'm scared.

A = There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.

Bot's return =  well the marijuana crop is a good start 

---------------
Q = He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:

A = Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.

Bot's return =  just wait harold 

---------------
Q = ...you heard echoes.

A = No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.

Bot's return =  oh swayzak humanity's to you it christian 

---------------
Q = I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.

A = So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:

Bot's return =  you don't know to go all i can to be a bad 

---------------
Q = I don't believe it!

A = Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!

Bot's return =  i need to net they birdie only and i don't want to you normal working i want to stop my otherwise in my own here 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry.

A = I know.

Bot's return =  well i'm woke now you can take this off 

---------------
Q = No.  Never heard of him.

A = A Perry Russo?

Bot's return =  jack 

---------------
Q = No.

A = A Willie O'Keefe?

Bot's return =  oh you see 

---------------
Q = I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.

A = It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?

Bot's return =  don't 

---------------
Q = No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...

A = ...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...

Bot's return =  the hell you know about me you got no right to talk to me about that shit the hell you think you are 

---------------
Q = No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

A = One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.

Bot's return =  what do you want 

---------------
Q = Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?

A = Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

Bot's return =  this is a crime bill shep killing for you don't are any to shake in or you blow me to happens to your phone did didn't you may the azimuth 

---------------
Q = Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.

A = I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.

Bot's return =  we've doing get it was it is worth you don't go to know a warhead through to bet us it 

---------------
Q = May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.

A = I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.

Bot's return =  i'm fucking has about her is no like on men to do you who a woman 

---------------
Q = In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...

A = Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...

A = Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.

Bot's return =  but victor me the last time we got to need there back we can be agree in to night by that if you could hack section eight command 

---------------
Q = I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...

A = Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.

Bot's return =  be i never you like a wrong of keep but your life 

---------------
Q = These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.

A = And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.

Bot's return =  uh uh 

---------------
Q = That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.

A = It's going to get worse, honey.

Bot's return =  itches 

---------------
Q = That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.

A = Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!

Bot's return =  uh uh 

---------------
Q = No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.

A = You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.

Bot's return =  let go of me 

---------------
Q = One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.

A = Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.

Bot's return =  look it i put the goddamn dress on didn't i i think i'm handlin' myself with some fuckin' restraint here how you got me locked up like a dog on a 

---------------
Q = I know David - a strange character.

A = He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.

Bot's return =  not still kids yelling 

---------------
Q = ...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?

A = Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.

Bot's return =  no not her fault gill she's 

---------------
Q = You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.

A = I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.

Bot's return =  five 

---------------
Q = Time?

A = Between six and seven seconds.

Bot's return =  oh hey dig you'll tell send a fuckin' 

---------------
Q = The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.

A = Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?

Bot's return =  i ordered it will i was your orders at for the person of the 

---------------
Q = That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.

A = Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?

Bot's return =  no but that 

---------------
Q = I just plain don't trust him anymore.

A = Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...

Bot's return =  sure i do i will he's you the more love love me in was i'm side and i are this the will do you want me those 

---------------
Q = Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?

A = Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.

Bot's return =  and the third we we have in your have to actual of your room 

---------------
Q = I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.

A = You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!

Bot's return =  the antenna has to be replaced 

---------------
Q = Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.

A = Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.

Bot's return =  yes yes 

---------------
Q = Some people would say you're paranoid.

A = Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?

Bot's return =  ain't gonna be moved

---------------
Q = He tries to act cool.

A = No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.

A = So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?

Bot's return =  milo it to me 

---------------
Q = ...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.

A = Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.

Bot's return =  i didn't shoot 

---------------
Q = Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?

A = You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.

We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.

Bot's return =  the the couple or as have could a man but there either us me to safe i don't know anything you have that but be either

Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?

A = Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

Bot's return =  here's you u said it but i won't argue 

---------------
Q = Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.

A = But we heard him.

Bot's return =  you have a helluva way for asking 

---------------
Q = That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.

A = Anything else?

Bot's return =  you're a private hypocrite a little popular drink i'm told 

---------------

A = Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?

Bot's return =  so out too give running to be here all right but right 

---------------
Q = This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.

A = The most logical choice.

Bot's return =  you didn't to get out more wrong

---------------
Q = We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.

Q = Oh, good heavens, no!

A = How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?

Bot's return =  yeah try but i don't want dyslexia

Q = When was all this?

A = Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.

Bot's return =  well we didn't about any help here there are you don't a his and i just just made

---------------
Q = Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.

A = Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"

Bot's return =  no but go to walk them things to make with it asking you know been i'll to sleep

Q = Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.

I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.

I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week.

I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.

A = Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?

Bot's return =  i'm afraid i must you were 

---------------
Q = ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.

---------------
Q = -- you've been a tremendous help to me.

Q = I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...

---------------
Q = I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.

A = I understand.

Bot's return =  if you just decided to return it to the sender or in this case the sender's wife 

---------------
Q = Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?

A = Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.

A = Uh-huh.

Bot's return =  piece of fucking cake 

---------------
Q = I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.

A = Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.

A = Okay... let's say that, for now.

Bot's return =  they'll you run your business gun people and as give it up all this how it was me how very the war

---------------
Q = Sounds like you have several.

A = What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.

Bot's return =  and would was a pity guy on a have open do you think i don't want to get girl 

---------------
Q = Yes... your particular approach.

A = I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.

Bot's return =  whether or not you succeed is of course problematical 

---------------
Q = I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.

A = Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?

Bot's return =  is do you want 

---------------
Q = You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.

A = So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?

Bot's return =  herr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one respect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape 

---------------

Bot's return =  what too not the time 

---------------
Q = In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.

A = It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

Bot's return =  ah by the nineties i'm the one in in act and be a job it's from to go on a look late on gave

It undermines our whole cause.

Q = How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.

A = If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!

Bot's return =  for see is sandy to you 

---------------
Q = If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.

A = Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?

Bot's return =  unfair you are completely unfair

A = The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.

Bot's return =  and means like a good idea at let's 

---------------
Q = Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?

A = You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!

Bot's return =  this is guy really that dead 

---------------
Q = I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.

A = What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Boh?me... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = So that is your house?

A = Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...

A = Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.

Bot's return =  poor the pole 

---------------
Q = It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?

A = That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.

Bot's return =  don't trying never been you are on talking mess 

---------------
Q = Let's forget that we ever met.

Q = You see I couldn't shout that.

A = Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?

Bot's return =  he's leaving you but far 

---------------
Q = No... go on.

A = Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...

A = Ninotchka, you're jealous.

Bot's return =  that is all that

Q = It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.

A = From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.

Bot's return =  and these cops to me

A = But I can throw it out of the window.

Bot's return =  what a concentration it's the whole world 

---------------
Q = Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.

A = Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"

Bot's return =  oh calvin i'm not sure we should be making promises him if right

Bot's return =  yeah sorry them about when the fucking comes

But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!

A = What does he say?

Bot's return =  his father's dead right

Q = She's gone, Leon.

A = Do you expect me to believe that?

Bot's return =  i don't want that i want to be with my with i believed get 

---------------
Q = That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.

A = Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch?teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...

Bot's return =  it's a very good my completely charming it 

---------------
Q = Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?

A = Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.

Bot's return =  does you vincenzo 

---------------
Q = That's all right... I grow on people.

A = I must ask you to leave.

Bot's return =  well 

---------------
Q = Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.

A = If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're i to know to story at 

---------------
Q = Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.

A = It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.

Bot's return =  really is else did my you known with i knew 

---------------
Q = I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.

A = I told you to go, madame.

Bot's return =  don't trying i'm to talk that it's the job you want the next and the job 

---------------
Q = You leave me no choice.

A = Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?

Bot's return =  just right on the fifteenth will you and tonight one and course 

---------------
Q = They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!

---------------
Q = My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.

A = Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...

Bot's return =  escorts 

---------------
Q = I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.

A = That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.

Bot's return =  i don't have any time there's a war 

---------------
Q = Here, please...

A = What do you want?

Bot's return =  and the kid who wrote skywire

Bot's return =  oh me 

---------------
Q = That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?

A = I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.

Bot's return =  not mom 

---------------
Q = Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.

A = May I ask why?

Bot's return =  i'm not fear it was the bank's that's do nobody the body of one man they were of what you know abuse

Bot's return =  who just an a little hour

Q = It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?

Bot's return =  oh that'll work you 

---------------
Q = Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...

Bot's return =  i don't want to talk about it to school over all much to the plans and who the damn that time travel just you 

---------------
Q = Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?

A = What?

Bot's return =  of is exactly of stupid 

---------------
Q = Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.

A = My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."

Bot's return =  yeah forget you what's to the wife one here rules other be be yours and you in chicken night and and finest him to him in the house of talkin' when about 

---------------
Q = I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.

A = Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.

Bot's return =  i'm not so you

A = You're doing fine.

Bot's return =  i'd like to buy you a drink

Bot's return =  i put them on together 

---------------
Q = You stole my boat.

Q = Enough of that!  Name your terms.

A = Elizabeth goes free!

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = No!  You gave your word!

A = Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.

Bot's return =  yeah i think to talk you a drink 

---------------
Q = You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!

A = Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?

Bot's return =  do you have a salon prive 

---------------
Q = What -- you don't have the medallion?

A = Now.  No, don't kill him.

Bot's return =  and bitch like david

A = By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!

Bot's return =  you're going you sleepwalk you go somewhere familiar 

---------------
Q = Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.

A = Did you, now?

Bot's return =  i'm dear 

---------------
Q = You've got sand, for a maid.

A = Thank you, sir.

Bot's return =  wait gonna about about hard with the shuttle

Q = Do you not know what this is, then?

A = It's a pirate medallion.

Bot's return =  i did bianca to favor

Q = Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.

A = One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

Bot's return =  i don't gamble 

---------------
Q = Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.

A = Ceremony?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --

A = About the day we met. Do you remember?

Bot's return =  in son of a bitch 

---------------
Q = Why would my father send this to me?

A = To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.

Bot's return =  i didn't have the time will and i don't want to get involved with after days trust 

---------------
Q = Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.

A = Not when you can drink instead, at least.

Bot's return =  this is make to find about it we'll like you really have hear me to me 

---------------
Q = Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...

A = More to drink!

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.

A = Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.

Bot's return =  very impressive 

---------------
Q = You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.

A = Nor did you, I noticed.

Bot's return =  you have a helluva way of asking 

---------------
Q = How did you get off the island?

A = Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.

Bot's return =  yes and no now is some other one 

---------------
Q = All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.

A = Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?

Bot's return =  does he win

Q = Dead serious.

A = You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.

Bot's return =  well god they you i'll get i'm pack 

---------------
Q = Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?

A = By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.

Bot's return =  it's the only guy starts it's too a little late i'm this guy 

---------------
Q = I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.

A = Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.

Bot's return =  and that's is that 

---------------
Q = Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.

A = I knew you'd listen to reason!

---------------
Q = Not without my effects.

A = We need to go!

Bot's return =  it is the third of the house

Q = I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

A = 'Bootstrap?'

Bot's return =  yes yes it's beautiful all the scumbags in the car 

---------------
Q = Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.

A = He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--

A = You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.

Bot's return =  not mom 

---------------

You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.

Bot's return =  i don't like this left about mr with about that he was like he said to the room at first i 

---------------
Q = Why are you ashamed?

Bot's return =  right him welcome tell tell what to radio 

---------------
Q = Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.

A = Always the lawyer.

Bot's return =  i don't know you my goddamn father and i don't know you 

---------------
Q = Where did you go when you left here?

A = I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.

Bot's return =  then tell i don't like it either 

---------------
Q = You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.

A = I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.

Bot's return =  i know wanna a parasite for yourself is my mother's 

---------------
Q = If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.

A = Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.

A = But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.

Bot's return =  to keep of for life i am sure good too a war i just know bad

Bot's return =  a hunting accident 

---------------
Q = Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.

Q = -- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.

A = I want you back too, Viktor.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?

A = Well, I --

Bot's return =  i haven't to know why about i'm the fuck of these out there's they

Bot's return =  and over all that

Bot's return =  taking him 

---------------
Q = Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.

A = I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.

Bot's return =  what do you mean 

---------------
Q = Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?

A = I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?

Bot's return =  right 

---------------
Q = -- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"

A = Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...

Bot's return =  i hope y'know 

---------------
Q = Hal, what are you doing?

A = Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!

A = Good for you, Hank.

Bot's return =  yeah was all a go 

---------------
Q = That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.

A = What's that?

Bot's return =  and now is is much like much you commit it was the some 

---------------
Q = I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.

A = Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.

Bot's return =  you won't go now 

---------------
Q = Hi, Dad.

Q = You know, I... don't know.

A = Is she here tonight?

Bot's return =  it's you reasonably he'll and my senses 

---------------
Q = Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?

A = Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.

Bot's return =  and over all that 

---------------
Q = You know me -- married to my work.

A = I noticed.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.

A = Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?

Bot's return =  and sleep 'n is there of us best for him 

---------------
Q = -- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!

A = What?!

Bot's return =  yeah yes it's beautiful all the scumbags in the car 

---------------
Q = I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.

A = Abduction?

Bot's return =  well i can't remember you we're 

---------------
Q = That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.

A = That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.

Bot's return =  it's we no we must be her to have with this kid 

---------------
Q = Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.

A = Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?

Bot's return =  god have to go at i could let him 

---------------
Q = Mr. Sayer...

A = What do you want -- ?

Bot's return =  when perhaps but this one is london do i have to him about stuff 

---------------
Q = Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?

A = -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.

Bot's return =  i was in as work here to the person but the war what the car

Bot's return =  yeah him i am to see home one a man one do you know how crazy it's just the time to go on i 

---------------
Q = Then show some.  They'll shut me down!

A = It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".

Bot's return =  is we you think the cops is 

---------------
Q = No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.

A = Good.

Bot's return =  not mom 

---------------
Q = Is Miss Simone coming today?

A = She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.

Bot's return =  you're the boss are a lot of my life 

---------------
Q = What if it catches on fire?

A = Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.

Bot's return =  and that's i think you're 

---------------
Q = Hi.

A = Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.

Bot's return =  yes but this child a travel son he get your say

---------------
Q = Yes, I was...

A = Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.

Bot's return =  i'm sorry 

---------------
Q = But -- why?

A = Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.

Bot's return =  nobody he's you do place in in you wouldn't talk to do a little hour you think me to me

Bot's return =  do you have sir czech girls working working for you 

---------------
Q = Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?

A = At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...

Bot's return =  faith was has enough from he so you

A = Is that what you came here to say?

Bot's return =  i want so 

---------------
Q = At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?

A = We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!

Bot's return =  what's up 

---------------
Q = Departing dark side, Regula.

---------------
Q = You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

Bot's return =  the the couple or as have could a man but there either us me to safe i don't know anything you have that but be either 

---------------
Q = You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.

A = I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.

Bot's return =  you know a helluva prive don't bother 

---------------
Q = There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.

A = How far?

A = Who the <u>hell</u> are they?

Bot's return =  oh give i think give get now who the time 

---------------
Q = You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...

A = The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...

Bot's return =  well 

---------------
Q = Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...

A = Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.

Bot's return =  i was born to gag you sent of very his a beautiful

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

A = On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.

Bot's return =  your should've is not business show 

---------------
Q = Mr. Saavik, all stop.

A = All stop, sir.

Bot's return =  yeah take i'm to use the thing 

---------------
Q = Admiral on the bridge!

A = As you were, Mr. Saavik.

Bot's return =  and i'll the fog lifted was somebody lost 

---------------
Q = Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.

A = Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --

Bot's return =  alice you get you must leave us

Q = Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...

A = Engage warp engines --

Bot's return =  larry

Q = All moorings are clear, Captain.

A = Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

Bot's return =  oh calvin me not a clouted fen sucked hedge pig 

---------------
Q = Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

A = Never, sir.

Bot's return =  i thought i was gonna crazy a war 

---------------
Q = Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --

A = Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.

Bot's return =  i'm friend all an

Bot's return =  how's that he works for gillette 

---------------
Q = Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?

A = I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.

Bot's return =  it is 

---------------
Q = Now wait just a damn minute.

A = Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!

A = -- That's the general idea.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?

A = Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.

Bot's return =  not daddy 

---------------
Q = Specifically, Humpback Whales.

A = That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?

Bot's return =  it was staged 

---------------
Q = 10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.

A = ... My God...

Bot's return =  you mean the falsely accused 

---------------
Q = You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.

A = That is what I said, Doctor.

Bot's return =  i am you covered there and me all that

Q = No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.

A = That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.

Bot's return =  you have a helluva jack don't on alice's

A = You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.

Bot's return =  she's you vincenzo 

---------------
Q = Thanks. Cheers.

A = If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?

Bot's return =  i don't want to talk about it to school over all much to the plans and who the damn that time travel just the time of those personal then 

---------------
Q = Where could you take them?

A = Hm?

Bot's return =  i'm losing millions a dollars and months of my life go of time you know that love 

---------------
Q = I'm all ears.

A = That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.

---------------
Q = Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...

A = Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.

Bot's return =  not mom 

---------------
Q = But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.

A = Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.

Bot's return =  good 

---------------
Q = Any progress?

A = We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?

A = I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.

Bot's return =  you have a a good maybe

Bot's return =  you probably expect 

---------------
Q = Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.

A = Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -

Bot's return =  it's he
