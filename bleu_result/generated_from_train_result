A = You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.

A = Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?

A = Yes?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.

A = It's possible.

Bot's return =  i believe afraid why fairy godmother but the other one of his own when i knew the nails so my wife and see exactly i think gonna that it was in this not my not not not not my not the side

Q = Oh?

A = Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.

Bot's return =  i don't know i just know the make i won't you from 

---------------
Q = No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

A = Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.

Bot's return =  is an is big 

---------------
Q = I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.

A = That seems very unlikely.

Bot's return =  why yes you end ' 

---------------
Q = How?

A = Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.

Bot's return =  what the hell are you on for town does 

---------------
Q = Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.

A = Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.

Bot's return =  he don't have saying listen guys 

---------------
Q = I know. It would be almost inconceivable.

A = But not completely inconceivable?

Bot's return =  i know just you are this they not here you can't something them be the road get in the letters

Bot's return =  ugh 

---------------
Q = Good morning. How's it going?

A = Are you reasonably awake?

Bot's return =  that's right 

---------------
Q = Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?

A = Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.

Bot's return =  just an expression him 

---------------
Q = Two more.

A = Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about i just your sorry about it 

---------------
Q = Hal?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = It's the last one.

A = Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.

Bot's return =  it's an six agreed to the political has is are the time 

---------------
Q = I guess not.

A = I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.

Bot's return =  look never him just the other 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.

A = He's got a point.

Bot's return =  what three he's do busy is dead today when you know 

---------------
Q = Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.

A = What is it, Hal?

Bot's return =  my point exactly 

---------------
Q = The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.

A = I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.

Bot's return =  you're i'd a little 

---------------
Q = Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.

A = Yes, I know.

Bot's return =  you need therapy i got you got more i know plus what is what he did and i minute you think me to me but i ever to the job and was a kid but he 

---------------
Q = You probably also know that we found them okay.

A = Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.

Bot's return =  what do you think to know 

---------------
Q = Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.

A = Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

Bot's return =  okay just calm 

---------------
Q = Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.

A = I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.

Bot's return =  and what 

---------------
Q = Well, don't worry about it.

A = And don't you worry about it.

A = The antenna has to be replaced.

Bot's return =  i'm looking to be what i can want to fuck about mr 

---------------
Q = If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.

A = I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.

Bot's return =  no if love 

---------------
Q = Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.

A = Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.

Bot's return =  what the hell are you doin' with da's gun 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

A = Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.

Bot's return =  if you know so so it was we'll go caught i think you should good me to street 

---------------
Q = I am prepared to do that anyway.

A = I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

Bot's return =  you're what the right and the way

Bot's return =  and these i am you i don't know home i 

---------------
Q = Really?

A = Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.

Bot's return =  you were always any that

A = Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.

Bot's return =  i think us need a choice 

---------------
Q = Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?

A = I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.

Bot's return =  no you don't have

Bot's return =  1922

Bot's return =  and matters 

---------------
Q = What do you mean?

A = Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about a big except at do are all a big time as just a big time as i was how to ask with it's better know ever where this a long place ago i want i'm stuff if if you gotta see it fix them to the police

Q = Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.

A = I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.

Bot's return =  has i'll to the police

Bot's return =  oh name i like i am i was blew too up of the world 

---------------
Q = I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...

A = I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.

A = If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.

Bot's return =  you know what the say i go and you don't pay 

---------------
Q = A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...

A = Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...

Bot's return =  anything new about the shooting twombley off seen what ten for you and i have such about about your job 

---------------
Q = You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.

Q = What about Luther?

A = What about Ganz?

Bot's return =  don't be my friend 

---------------
Q = Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.

A = Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.

Bot's return =  they won't he was a roll 

---------------
Q = They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

A = So you took the rest of the night off...

Bot's return =  you're why actually here to work it you don't all the sex in the war 

---------------
Q = Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?

Bot's return =  yes ain't drops why don't you fuck 

---------------

Q = It's late, they're closing...

A = Don't worry about it.

Bot's return =  i don't remember you saying no

Q = Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...

A = What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...

Bot's return =  listen night daddy mommy 

---------------
Q = There are reasons for the way we do things here.

A = Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...

Bot's return =  and the problem is you only got three 

---------------
Q = Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.

A = Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're i just this to hell i can't but my you but them from it i respect you should me jesse to get with it's

---------------
Q = This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

A = I'm not so sure about this.

Bot's return =  you could what as he i got want to you

Q = I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.

A = You enjoy it?

Bot's return =  don't not my favorite it will have needed two for are the money 

---------------
Q = Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.

A = Tell me what happened.

Bot's return =  oh absolutely you complainin' 

---------------
Q = What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...

Bot's return =  not just tradition 

---------------
Q = Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?

A = Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.

---------------
Q = So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

A = That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.

Bot's return =  just long as x in the thank 

---------------
Q = Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.

A = I was well compensated.

Bot's return =  don't be talk me if 

---------------
Q = That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?

A = Never mind how I found you.

---------------
Q = Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...

A = They're no friends of mine.

Bot's return =  you look

Q = Except, you're willing commit murder with them.

A = Three, four years.

Bot's return =  who's the son who cheated i got you know okay to make me once on me too i'm only 

---------------
Q = Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...

A = There's not much illegal.

Bot's return =  where's ich 

---------------
Q = Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.

A = You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.

Bot's return =  what here's i do it's such 

---------------
Q = I'm not a cop.

A = You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.

Bot's return =  it's not a real episode the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones 

---------------
Q = Not quite.

A = From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?

Bot's return =  it's 

---------------
Q = Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.

A = How much?

Bot's return =  i told you i don't know 

---------------
Q = How much do you make now?

A = Four hundred a week, off the books.

Bot's return =  what are you think 

---------------
Q = Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.

A = Sounds good, pops.

Bot's return =  if you did michael dukakis you're this a few who's important on time to go out 

---------------
Q = ... Hello... ?

A = Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.

Bot's return =  pity you can one me 

---------------
Q = You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.

A = Interesting theory.

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.

A = Child pornography.

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.

A = Snuff films.

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.

A = What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?

Bot's return =  our night asleep 

---------------
Q = How old are you?

A = Twenty-five.

Bot's return =  sometimes i think i do

---------------
Q = I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?

A = I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?

Bot's return =  i'm sorry for that i can sir 

---------------
Q = You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.

A = Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.

Bot's return =  you need five years training to handle a joint like 

---------------
Q = You're telling me it doesn't get to you?

A = You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?

Bot's return =  of i want a up dear here 

---------------
Q = A daughter.

A = So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?

Bot's return =  there's you shouldn't me 

---------------
Q = His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.

A = Specialty product.

Bot's return =  of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol 

---------------
Q = You're learning.

A = Where does he sell it?

Bot's return =  make yourself my majesty

Q = Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...

A = Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...

Bot's return =  and the bodies 

---------------
Q = Alright, I get the picture.

A = He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.

Bot's return =  i wish i had talk myself in 

---------------
Q = Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?

A = I'm a working stiff, pops.

Bot's return =  right that checks out here 

---------------
Q = Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.

A = See ya.

Bot's return =  i'm an asthmatic been one all my life can't go anywhere without an inhaler 

---------------

---------------
Q = Who is he?

A = I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Who is he, his name?

A = Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.

Bot's return =  hang we do 

---------------
Q = I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."

A = "Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.

Bot's return =  what did any danger some kind of virus 

---------------
Q = What's next?

A = I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.

Bot's return =  no you don't any 

---------------
Q = Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?

A = Nope.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = What's this?

A = It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.

Bot's return =  i know what you've been doing 

---------------
Q = Look... that's awful generous and everything...

A = It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.

Bot's return =  yes i know 

---------------
Q = Mister Welles. You're very prompt.

A = I try to be.

Bot's return =  not not at wait work an 

---------------
Q = Uh huh, pleasure.

A = Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.

Bot's return =  one thing i blew it out the goddamn airlock like i said so you said if angry 

---------------
Q = Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?

A = Thank you.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = He's odd.

A = He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...

Bot's return =  i thought you were asleep 

---------------
Q = I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.

A = I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.

Bot's return =  nothing never had now never for about don juan on was his it will take 

---------------
Q = As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.

A = My condolences.

Bot's return =  when thanks my father 

---------------
Q = His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.

A = I'll do whatever I can to help.

Bot's return =  oh on 

---------------
Q = Pittsburgh?

A = Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.

Bot's return =  i'm not 

---------------
Q = Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?

A = I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...

A = Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.

Bot's return =  i need to net they birdie only and i don't want to you no no when you did 

---------------
Q = Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...

A = I'm telling you it's not that.

Bot's return =  i'm getting naive you learn 

---------------
Q = I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.

A = Will you watch it and see for yourself?

Bot's return =  do in 

---------------
Q = You... you need to go to the police.

A = I told you I can't, not yet.

Bot's return =  don't serious me with me too 

---------------
Q = You don't have any other choice.

A = No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...

Bot's return =  then i live you a postcard 

---------------
Q = It won't work like that.

A = Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.

Bot's return =  now you know there's the prestige of the job title 

---------------
Q = Nothing remotely like this.

A = I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.

Bot's return =  how'd that's impossible you're the dead 

---------------
Q = Okay...

A = My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.

Bot's return =  i took i had your 

---------------
Q = I'm not positive this means anything.

A = The checks were for odd amounts...

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite is like you all this too i be angry of your country no no more in the country and your life have been pressure not didn't a go of some in your that one in there 

---------------
Q = One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...

A = Okay, I follow you so far...

Bot's return =  no no i my care i'm that poor i'll i'll be the truth 

---------------
Q = Hello... ?

A = I'm here.

Bot's return =  when you know cows and i got some tell you drive on him at least here i don't think there oh help i mean like is but i should go in there there oh he was a show together i didn't know the side the rest i've i mean her but a fun 

---------------
Q = Do you think the film could have cost that much?

A = For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.

Bot's return =  to dubious distinction no like two get he's to do care 

---------------
Q = You told me to look, so I looked.

A = You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.

Bot's return =  oh what are you killed oh 

---------------
Q = Hello?

A = Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

Bot's return =  i remember 

---------------
Q = How are you?  Having any luck?

A = I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?

Bot's return =  can killed 

---------------
Q = I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.

A = I hope it's nothing serious.

Bot's return =  not thanks had been you are 

---------------
Q = Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?

A = I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.

Bot's return =  don't even say it man 

---------------
Q = I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.

A = How will I get it to you?

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = Yes... ?

A = Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...

Bot's return =  to hire yes is an be her 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?

A = Yes, but...

Bot's return =  to go up 

---------------
Q = What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...

A = Neil... Neil Cole.

Bot's return =  look now i'm pumping you i'm sorry it's none of my business it's just that you're not like the others 

---------------
Q = It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.

A = They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?

Bot's return =  what do you mean 

---------------
Q = I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.

A = You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.

Bot's return =  not you don't have 

---------------
Q = So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = She just seemed... depressed... ?

A = She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.

Bot's return =  yeah is pamela landy 

---------------
Q = What was she running from?

A = I don't know.

Q = If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?

A = There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...

Bot's return =  ted i don't want to stay here it's time for us to me and i just just like to new that my life not just her time hour lo for to meaning at a no a job of those a few it's board things had 

---------------
Q = I didn't mean to...

A = You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = I had to ask.  I apologize.

A = No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.

Bot's return =  but you took my request 

---------------
Q = People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?

A = Of course.

Bot's return =  there not with have very do your father in stock 

---------------
Q = I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

A = Okay.

Bot's return =  the duke what did you do 

---------------
Q = Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.

A = We're all like that.

Bot's return =  you don't want to you my couldn't 

---------------
Q = Are you religious?

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.

A = What?

Bot's return =  wazoo try to listen whataya think surfer grunge hip hop euro trash 

---------------
Q = It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.

A = There wasn't one.  The police looked.

Bot's return =  i know you didn't is bad not is but i said have 

---------------
Q = Do you think the police did a good job?

A = I don't know.  I think so.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...

A = No.  You don't have any reason to think that...

Bot's return =  i don't have i get you should and 

---------------
Q = How... how can you say that to me...?

A = Will you let me look?

Bot's return =  can't help you 

---------------
Q = My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...

A = You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?

Bot's return =  you have any children 

---------------
Q = You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.

A = It's been six years.

Bot's return =  i haven't out of the trunk of pussy 

---------------
Q = Hello... ?

A = Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...

Bot's return =  i need to net they birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely but if she won't fly to my aid then into a ghost i must fade to a ghost i must fade to a ghost i must fade 

---------------
Q = I remember.  You just left...

A = I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...

A = Who are you?

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...

A = No...

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...

A = No... no... no...

Bot's return =  you don't have to do a don't car don't friend 

---------------
Q = They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...

A = Why... why are you doing this to me... ?

Bot's return =  you feelin' on single the last way for are you like this stuff in that shit did are a fucking of you're much a man more for place

Q = Do you know what happened to her?

A = I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.

---------------
Q = What is this?

A = Those are her belongings.

Bot's return =  i feel sure guys i don't have you want them from it is some you're me 

---------------
Q = Her belongings?

A = That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

Bot's return =  you must believe me 

---------------
Q = Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?

A = She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

Bot's return =  bullshit 

---------------
Q = No, sir, he is not.

A = He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...

A = Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.

Bot's return =  i doubt it she's

Q = Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?

A = No, you may not.

Bot's return =  you do

Q = I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...

A = Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.

---------------
Q = Well, do you still plan to get married?

A = Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.

Bot's return =  no i really don't 

---------------
Q = Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.

A = They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?

Bot's return =  ted i don't want to stay here it's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war 

---------------
Q = I don't know. You tell me.

A = Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?

Bot's return =  how much 

---------------
Q = Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?

A = Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified through times and uh gonna gonna difference in a pan than year 

---------------
Q = So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

A = A hunting accident is perfect.

Bot's return =  yes that checks got i did tell new for a fucking of everyone of time time ever difference with that can of found she's have you know his i can to find her i'm job that shit she's you could it then good a hell of fucking then i not about over 

---------------
Q = It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?

A = Not particularly.

Bot's return =  i believe we share still art instructor 

---------------
Q = Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?

A = I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?

Bot's return =  of that's what that 

---------------
Q = I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.

A = Yeah.

Bot's return =  then you do cows and shagging my you 

---------------
Q = I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.

A = Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?

Bot's return =  you'll night let you she 

---------------
Q = It may have happened, but not the way you said.

A = You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?

A = We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.

Bot's return =  yes i needed have those 

---------------
Q = I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.

Bot's return =  take it 

---------------
Q = I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.

A = For what?

Bot's return =  you want that 

---------------
Q = To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

A = Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.

Bot's return =  don't even say it man anything to the archives i was work a you from stop from reputation but it was me it's shit

A = Some kids were teasing you?

Q = You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.

A = Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.

Bot's return =  i want you to meet some other 

---------------
Q = It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.

---------------
Q = Uh, George...

A = Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?

Bot's return =  what's suck night going in else 

---------------
Q = George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.

---------------
Q = With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.

A = It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.

Q = Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.

A = Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.

Bot's return =  and it's the same 

---------------
Q = Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?

A = Sure.  Just a minute.

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job 

---------------
Q = Hope their plumbing's the same.

A = It is.

A = Say again?  All after incinerators?

Bot's return =  man your sorry heard for me 

---------------
Q = I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.

Bot's return =  i was born a hand will i'm ass to you 

---------------
Q = Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.

A = Yes.  That follows.

Bot's return =  i've had just the shooting right in 

---------------
Q = But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.

A = That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.

Bot's return =  okay if you going this do that your life 

---------------
Q = You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?

A = Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.

Bot's return =  you mean i could a lot of shit better go a great

Bot's return =  wazoo try to listen whataya think surfer grunge hip hop euro trash 

---------------
Q = I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

A = All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?

Bot's return =  i don't have just want to help about i believed my head 

---------------
Q = It's going to be closer.  You better get going.

A = See you soon.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Ripley...

A = She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = You did okay, Bishop.

A = Well, thanks, I --

Bot's return =  i thought you might have 

---------------
Q = Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

A = You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?

Bot's return =  and the problem is you only got three

Bot's return =  and the only alternative and and he the details earlier 

---------------
Q = I get the picture.

A = Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.

Bot's return =  you like to talk you don't and i got something how a wait 

---------------
Q = You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.

A = They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.

Bot's return =  ted 

---------------
Q = No.  There's no way!

A = Hear me out...

Bot's return =  you don't have 

---------------
Q = What about you?  What's your interest in this?

A = Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about i just wanna these up 

---------------
Q = That's right.

A = Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?

Bot's return =  i look mean to scare you like that 

---------------
Q = It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.

A = What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?

Bot's return =  because if a supervisor knew like a question democrat just a couple of i want the fuck and he the job my point for my town the likes i've because because one one can but a very i can tell the job and god personal hands 

---------------
Q = Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...

A = No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.

Bot's return =  you were take her 

---------------
Q = Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

A = Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.

Bot's return =  i'm not even 

---------------
Q = You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?

A = Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talkin' about 

---------------
Q = I hope you're right.  I really do.

A = I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.

Bot's return =  of course not the best you owe yourself to me for you want to come for the house three 

---------------
Q = That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.

A = She's right.

Bot's return =  i hope those guys are all right 

---------------
Q = Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --

A = They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?

Bot's return =  i'm in it a good sign 

---------------
Q = This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --

A = Bullshit!

Bot's return =  the important of fedex yeah do sorry to tell about this can you find it all all quick 

---------------
Q = You son of a bitch.

A = Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

Bot's return =  and you're because is i had god just a little 

---------------
Q = What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.

A = Corporal Hicks!?

Bot's return =  of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol 

---------------
Q = You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.

A = But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --

Bot's return =  yes ma'am i know 

---------------
Q = Now, wait a second --

A = You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.

Bot's return =  of course not the king is many 

---------------
Q = You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?

A = Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.

Bot's return =  crystal 

---------------
Q = Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.

A = You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.

Bot's return =  maybe come the ask it you don't all the sex in the job of own about gonna me my own and me this this gonna be there shit us gonna gonna gonna 

---------------
Q = Still nothing from the colony?

Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!

Q = Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?

A = Money! Money!

Bot's return =  where how'd you hear that

A = Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?

Bot's return =  don't the contrary are a man 

---------------
Q = I see that you're expecting.

A = Oh, yes.

Bot's return =  yes back and tell give for a go 

---------------
Q = When, may I ask?

A = In three months! Papa.

Bot's return =  good good you end let's 

---------------
Q = What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.

A = But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!

Bot's return =  don't u president 

---------------
Q = Hey!

A = Hey!

Bot's return =  here it is

Q = I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.

Q = I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.

A = Gertrude!

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.

A = People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.

Bot's return =  what are you think here 

---------------
Q = What a strange young man.

A = Yes. He is a little strange.

Bot's return =  i don't want to patient ammunition 

---------------
Q = Really?

A = Ah, now! Here she comes.

Q = I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.

A = Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.

Bot's return =  i did bianca to be it yet 

---------------
Q = I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.

A = You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

Bot's return =  first a million 

---------------
Q = What a charming idea. May I see?

Bot's return =  you can't forgive me after what i've done i've fucked up bigtime i've been bad real bad 

---------------
Q = Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?

A = You do me too much honour, Sire.

Bot's return =  you can't check in him 

---------------
Q = A-flat, Majesty.

A = Ah-ha!

Bot's return =  what are you coming here 

---------------
Q = And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.

A = Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!

Bot's return =  um 

---------------
Q = My pleasure.

A = Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?

Bot's return =  this forget dugan 

---------------
Q = Well, I'm glad to hear that.

A = Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.

Q = Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

A = Your Highness.

Bot's return =  when thanks my in now

Q = An interesting idea, Majesty. But -

A = Yes?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.

A = And the result satisfies.

Bot's return =  you see the ask you moment 

---------------
Q = Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.

A = Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.

Bot's return =  anyway i was just showing you this guy as an example 

---------------
Q = I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.

A = You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.

Bot's return =  of seems 

---------------
Q = Sire.

A = Well. There it is.

Bot's return =  the duke man nothing contraband the attack 

---------------
Q = I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.

A = Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american it's a pig scale a good knees 

---------------
Q = Why not?

A = Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.

Bot's return =  what do you have danny 

---------------
Q = Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.

A = Of course not.

Bot's return =  why let is tell who's men here 

---------------
Q = I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.

A = Really?

Bot's return =  the duke what did you do 

---------------
Q = Do you like this, Salieri?

A = It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

Bot's return =  they're this do you want do done is 

---------------
Q = Your Majesty!

A = No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?

Bot's return =  yes i know 

---------------
Q = And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.

A = Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!

Q = Why so?

A = Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!

Bot's return =  yeah what he did you come it begins 

---------------
Q = Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.

A = It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -

Bot's return =  yeah i'm a real genius and i are right because done now being will i did now but a piece of my life no one you shall 

---------------
Q = Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.

A = What? On one hearing only?

Bot's return =  don't need 

---------------
Q = It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?

A = Yes, indeed.

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = And German?

A = Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!

Bot's return =  you could any me 

---------------
Q = So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?

A = Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.

Bot's return =  why 

---------------
Q = What do you mean, Sire?

A = Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?

Bot's return =  no i really i think just anything know never i'll get 

---------------
Q = I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.

A = My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?

Bot's return =  i wish i had that luxury i'm the key 

---------------
Q = My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.

A = Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?

Bot's return =  yeah to leave you all determined 

---------------
Q = Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?

A = Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.

Bot's return =  ugh 

---------------
Q = Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.

A = Thank you, Sire!

Bot's return =  i see well thank you very much 

---------------
Q = Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?

A = What is it?

Bot's return =  you want to 

---------------
Q = May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.

A = Ah! By all means.

Bot's return =  fuck it you'll need it in america 

---------------
Q = Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?

A = Who told you this, Majesty?

Bot's return =  i was in you've go unnoticed roy i wish him 

---------------
Q = It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?

A = Well, yes, I admit it is.

Bot's return =  what do you want an apology 

---------------
Q = Would you tell me why?

A = Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

Bot's return =  no for does did the way we done 

---------------
Q = Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.

A = Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.

Bot's return =  gary you do well what 

---------------
Q = Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.

A = Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!

Bot's return =  a puppy's got he had write 

---------------
Q = Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.

A = You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.

Bot's return =  look the other that bad 

---------------
Q = Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?

A = I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.

Bot's return =  thank 

---------------
Q = Yes, sir.

A = Well. There it is.

Bot's return =  the duke man nothing contraband the attack 

---------------
Q = Well, what do you have for me today?

A = Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -

Bot's return =  it's you did worked start wearing 

---------------
Q = Yes, what about him?

A = He's here.

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.

A = I will.

Bot's return =  that's not 

---------------
Q = Why are you here?

A = Am I not welcome?

Bot's return =  yeah i'm going to be my i got how in the trunk of the loins of the loins but no now to ask with you

Q = Do you always live like this?

A = Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.

Bot's return =  aunt barbara is out you need be about for you want 

---------------
Q = Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

A = How is your financial situation?

Bot's return =  oh 

---------------
Q = What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.

A = They say you're in debt.

Bot's return =  uh yes 

---------------
Q = Pupils?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = How many?

Bot's return =  i thought you might have 

---------------
Q = I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.

A = Composition doesn't pay. You know that.

Bot's return =  i think that frank wants you little work your been way 

---------------
Q = What's that?

A = Oh, let's not talk about it.

Bot's return =  i don't know much about her crazy i

Q = Why not?

A = It's a secret.

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.

A = Why didn't you mention it in your letters?

Bot's return =  what do you want 

---------------
Q = Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.

A = Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!

Bot's return =  and his baggage

Bot's return =  look now i'm pumping you i'm sorry it's none of my business it's just that you're not like the others 

---------------
Q = 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.

A = Animals?

A = And which one of them do you want me to teach?

Q = No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.

A = But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!

A = It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.

Bot's return =  of what correct 

---------------
Q = How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!

A = How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.

Bot's return =  you need her of them 

---------------
Q = They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!

A = Of course not.

Bot's return =  why let is tell who's men here 

---------------
Q = Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!

A = Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.

Bot's return =  you'll see 

---------------
Q = I can't say. Really

A = I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?

Bot's return =  oh leaving you didn't 

---------------
Q = Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?

A = It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.

Bot's return =  oh if you revolting me those it's one 

---------------
Q = Really? Why?

A = I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?

Bot's return =  oh can't can't be a minute there's it 

---------------
Q = How fortunate.

A = It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.

Bot's return =  oh if then a big of you're i want to make it's how to ask what already 

---------------
Q = But what is it they don't like?

A = Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.

Bot's return =  you don't know what i say sir this is i have want anything thing done she soon her gonna 

---------------
Q = What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?

A = I think it's marvelous. Truly.

Bot's return =  look a rumor in all a true 

---------------
Q = It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?

A = I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?

Bot's return =  really a rumor on the fuck 

---------------
Q = I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.

A = I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.

Bot's return =  of i thought you use the one 

---------------
Q = Mozart. It was good of you to come.

A = How could I not?

Bot's return =  a got to keep that right 

---------------
Q = Did my work please you?

A = How could it not, Excellency?

Bot's return =  this is a 44 magnum a very popular 

---------------
Q = Yes?

A = I never knew that music like that was possible.

Bot's return =  okay i live you so said so dreams of the road water said you got love if your time you don't remember to make your friends and the little world you i when

A = Finish what?

Bot's return =  give me absolution 

---------------
Q = Would you? Actually, you could.

A = My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.

Bot's return =  no if you wanna on 

---------------
Q = But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.

A = Of course.

Bot's return =  there not with have very do your father in stock 

---------------
Q = You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.

A = Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?

Bot's return =  nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions in the let side but a man he's it's a benefit and their things some you and matt a murder on one to know answer 

---------------
Q = Where did I stop?

A = The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.

Bot's return =  i'm sorry is that i can about wally to the times mr been there's and you're like this one

A = May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?

Bot's return =  i don't want to be the same about it i don't make it all i won't this i don't care it 

---------------
Q = Mozart -

A = Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

Bot's return =  ten bucks says miles 

---------------
Q = Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?

A = Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?

Bot's return =  and i thought you were but the only to the car has i had keep my that but i could told done that her 

---------------
Q = What do you want?

A = I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = About what?

A = You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?

Bot's return =  you're a liar on you 

---------------
Q = So?

A = In the sight of God that is a sin.

Bot's return =  i'd a rumor in 

---------------
Q = What do you want?

A = Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.

Bot's return =  maybe you shouldn't be working here so much you don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life 

---------------
Q = Leave me alone.

A = I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite you don't feel any sorrier on the side of that town 

---------------
Q = Are they?

A = Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.

Bot's return =  i don't know what to say out it 

---------------
Q = I do not seek forgiveness.

A = My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.

Bot's return =  our abstinence makes to the window 

---------------
Q = Where?

A = Here in Vienna.

Bot's return =  just the my 

---------------
Q = I can't say I do. What is it?

A = I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?

Bot's return =  it's why where 

---------------
Q = Well?

A = I regret it is not too familiar.

Bot's return =  not thanks to see the why 

---------------
Q = Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.

A = I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?

Bot's return =  you're we got to be vindictive 

---------------
Q = Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.

A = Ah - you've heard that?

Bot's return =  i got us through 

---------------
Q = All Vienna has heard that.

A = And do they believe it?

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Is it true?

A = Do you believe it?

Bot's return =  this one's still with the fire department of when more you're not knew and to wife him 

---------------
Q = Do you hear me?

A = He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

Bot's return =  german 

---------------
Q = It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.

A = Did you try?

Bot's return =  can't go just you can do you think do me much in shit here when you drinking me at you lost it you'll 

---------------
Q = Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.

A = You cannot say that!

Bot's return =  look people undress in public because a they're exhibitionists b they're nutcases or c they need the money i can tell you're not a and i hope to hell you're not b so my suggestion is think about why you're a c and let your body party shake your groove thing boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more 

---------------
Q = No? Was Mozart a good man?

A = God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.

Bot's return =  madame i will respect his he asked me to stay here 

---------------
Q = All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!

A = My son, no one can speak for God.

Bot's return =  and that's is that 

---------------
Q = Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!

A = I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.

Bot's return =  you're what isn't the matter of many he's a hundred of shit of those ready about the way kids 

---------------
Q = What?

A = His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?

Bot's return =  why else jesus it 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.

Bot's return =  of i thought you use the rest in washington 

---------------
Q = Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.

A = I did.

Bot's return =  i told you too 

---------------
Q = No, you didn't!

A = I poisoned his life.

Bot's return =  look i had i i i love i probably want here talking i had 

---------------
Q = But not his body.

A = What difference does that make?

Bot's return =  that's sir 

---------------
Q = My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?

A = No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!

Bot's return =  yeah if why you're 

---------------
Q = Oh my son, my poor son!

A = Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.

Bot's return =  touch of the flu 

---------------
Q = I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.

A = Yes?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry

Q = He's setting that play to music?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = Where?

A = Never mind.

Bot's return =  i can't 

---------------
Q = What anger?

A = About the ballet.

Bot's return =  i accept your proposal 

---------------
Q = Ballet? What ballet?

A = Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?

Bot's return =  oh was they what you want so you her much the war 

---------------
Q = Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?

A = Yes, in the third act.

Bot's return =  i think evelyn it we've to you sir it but a way cut 

---------------
Q = Oh yes, yes. And that was?

A = Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.

Bot's return =  i wasn't sure you were the same in revenge i shall done long been well i hate 

---------------
Q = Here I am, my angel.

A = What? Who the devil are you?

Bot's return =  i can't told to ask it but the truth thing i wouldn't you might it sonuvabitch look

Q = I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.

A = I can't wait.

Bot's return =  we likely to his my sorry in use is to me in here your only trained separately 

---------------
Q = This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.

A = I agree, Baron.

Bot's return =  still i heard what 

---------------
Q = How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.

A = Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.

Bot's return =  i need to net the negro middle

Q = What does he want?

A = He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.

Bot's return =  yes and i just who you're here 

---------------
Q = Herr Salieri.

A = Yes, I am looking after him.

Bot's return =  i need it's been to you into they not had father and you're he said very thing

A = Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.

A = What do you mean, 'how did he look'?

Bot's return =  you see anything in our 

---------------
Q = You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?

A = I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

Bot's return =  you can always 

---------------
Q = Go about your duties.

A = Yes, Doctor.

Bot's return =  i'm an asthmatic been one all my life can't go anywhere without an inhaler 

---------------
Q = Oh, Miss Price?

A = Yes, Doctor?

Bot's return =  i'm an asthmatic been one all my life can't go anywhere without an inhaler 

---------------
Q = What exactly did he call out?

A = He said 'Jack'.

Bot's return =  well you had better 

---------------
Q = That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.

A = What happened to them?

Bot's return =  fuck it hold tight 

---------------
Q = The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.

A = No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.

Bot's return =  and you're what that was we'll did and i had this isn't before now much long now much now much much i don't was you to know what he did open then is a very from on

Q = It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.

A = Come to my office, Miss Price.

Bot's return =  it is a human of liking 

---------------
Q = Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.

A = Yes, sir.

A = At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

Bot's return =  it's not her fault gill she's 

---------------
Q = He's not?

A = Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?

Bot's return =  oh sick i'm keys is 

---------------
Q = Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.

A = Has his friend appeared to him again?

Bot's return =  young man i am no stranger to theatres i'm no stranger to insolence 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = What did he say?

Bot's return =  it's jack

A = Warn him?

Bot's return =  but one of course the movie is you being i'm your own about your your your what at 

---------------
Q = Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?

A = I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.

Bot's return =  not daddy 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.

Bot's return =  is an is big of trouble now didn't see you know for one 

---------------
Q = And what else?

A = I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.

Bot's return =  you're serious 

---------------
Q = You've absolutely no idea where David might be?

A = No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.

Bot's return =  has anybody you didn't 

---------------
Q = Surely you're not suggesting...

A = David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

Bot's return =  i need to net they birdie only and i don't want to you normal but i don't want anything but a job easy job that those job and for this job it's my own here and beautiful being for a couple down can't good as be a big like it's can't have not have a deal of the company have could other a

A = Yes, I should think so.

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?

A = Yes, Doctor.

Bot's return =  i'm an asthmatic been one all my life can't go anywhere without an inhaler 

---------------
Q = Shall I send a car?

A = No, a cab will be faster.

Bot's return =  that's you hand me

Bot's return =  you can't threaten me 

---------------
Q = Yes, go on.

A = Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...

Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.

---------------
Q = There's only four of them...

A = Move you fools!

Bot's return =  you beat 'em to shit pal jesus 

---------------
Q = Really!

A = NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!

Bot's return =  and i do what a human 

---------------
Q = Good.

A = Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.

Bot's return =  does i was i too do too to happen 

---------------
Q = Just perfect.

A = A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.

Bot's return =  you can't threaten me 

---------------
Q = Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --

A = I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!

Bot's return =  man i don't want to go into this 

---------------
Q = Your men knew the risks.

A = What is going on here, man?

Bot's return =  well i'll be an alabama porch monkey's uncle 

---------------
Q = With my money!

A = We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!

Bot's return =  i guess to do it when you how do a strange it's not 

---------------
Q = The final route for the railroad is complete.

A = I look forward to seeing it.

Bot's return =  not in all the movie 

---------------
Q = Parker.

A = Sir?

Bot's return =  i love you 

---------------
Q = What is that?

A = What, sir?

Bot's return =  mr much the most wonderful here him that can more with in here man over one of there 

---------------
Q = How did you know?

A = Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?

Bot's return =  i guess to do but i were go 

---------------
Q = You wouldn't have done that?

A = Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.

Bot's return =  sorry you me fucking me i was expecting 

---------------
Q = I want them arrested and hanged!

A = Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.

Bot's return =  no battle no blackface 

---------------
Q = This is no game.

A = I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.

Bot's return =  well if you wanna work in the post office you'll have to stick out your tongue 

---------------
Q = "A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."

A = It is a nice piece of writing.

Bot's return =  oh well jesus it you don't like how to wait her oh 

---------------
Q = "The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!

A = Oh, that's the best part.

Bot's return =  what do you want an apology 

---------------
Q = It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.

A = I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!

Bot's return =  i like it up here 

---------------
Q = First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.

A = I can't believe this.

Bot's return =  don't worry you think i can i go answer be u on u a lot and i got you back after to him and them 

---------------
Q = No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?

A = Can't you tell me anything?

Bot's return =  take help get i don't know much i got get on the street trust i have want i should her i should the car and i got on a man in those like i got what's good good a screen test like a man named like a 

---------------
Q = So he's won.

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.

A = In English, Pinkerton.

Bot's return =  you don't understand you either 

---------------
Q = There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.

A = Can you put men at all four?

Bot's return =  don't ain't war we'll to be back i can't know now you gotta be our no a fool of shit 

---------------
Q = No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.

A = What is that?

A = 'Have a look?

Bot's return =  you treated me like shit 

---------------
Q = Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.

A = ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.

Bot's return =  i wish i had that luxury i'm the only sophomore that got 

---------------
Q = No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.

A = ...Worse?

Bot's return =  you can't forgive me after what i've done i've fucked up bigtime i've been bad real bad 

---------------
Q = Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.

A = Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

Bot's return =  good leaving were teasing it as poor like i made you are people some him but you know

Q = That's great! Thanks.

A = 'Sorry about the late notice...

Bot's return =  i didn't mean to scare you like that dress 

---------------
Q = "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?

A = I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.

Q = I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.

A = I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.

Bot's return =  oh i know 

---------------
Q = I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.

A = I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.

Bot's return =  how'd you learn so much about dreams

Bot's return =  okay i was give the family do the whole i could

Q = Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.

A = They'd frame him.

Bot's return =  i said 

---------------
Q = He's out of prison?

A = They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."

Bot's return =  one thing at a time laz 

---------------
Q = He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.

A = What about "60 Minutes."

Bot's return =  i see what 

---------------
Q = Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."

A = But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --

Bot's return =  what is a 44 magnum 

---------------
Q = Time?

A = Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!

A = A what?

Bot's return =  wazoo 

---------------
Q = You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?

A = It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.

Bot's return =  his father's dead right 

---------------
Q = Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.

A = Before they kill somebody else, too.

If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --

A = Gary.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.

A = The dishes are juiced up, too.

Bot's return =  look a rumor going around him a but a half hour tomorrow to his 

---------------
Q = Thank God.

A = Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.

Bot's return =  the antenna has to be replaced 

---------------
Q = They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.

A = He doesn't know about the Day Care.

Bot's return =  aye here an people you know to get about this one he's be in

Bot's return =  oh if you ever switch about

Q = Why?!

A = She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.

Bot's return =  for even say you somethin' want a do to kiss that shit

A = We know all that, Exposition.

Bot's return =  look you shouldn't be out 

---------------
Q = I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.

A = Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.

Bot's return =  i can't wait to be among you

Bot's return =  how you put it again be that muthafucka that's with with right

A = No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.

Bot's return =  but a liar 

---------------
Q = Vanessa's one of our top agents.

A = My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.

Bot's return =  our entertainment makes to want 

---------------
Q = Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

A = Thank you, Exposition.

Bot's return =  i love you too see you tomorrow

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.

A = Thank you, Exposition.

Bot's return =  i love you too see you tomorrow 

---------------
Q = Oh, and Austin...

A = Yes?

Q = Hello, Exposition.

A = Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.

Bot's return =  what there any danger some kind of virus 

---------------
Q = Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.

Bot's return =  go on laz you can talk to me

Q = Carnies.

A = What?

Bot's return =  wazoo try to listen whataya think surfer grunge hip hop euro trash 

---------------
Q = Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.

A = Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.

Bot's return =  to does who about to me not that would not wanted to me 

---------------
Q = Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.

A = Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.

Bot's return =  i believe you said let's it down 

---------------
Q = My God, Austin, what have you done?

A = That's not your mother, that's a man!

Bot's return =  oh what 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.

A = Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!

Bot's return =  but we meant it 

---------------
Q = All right, Austin, I think you should go.

A = I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.

Bot's return =  i'm impressed 

---------------
Q = I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?

A = Yes, Basil?

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = Be careful.

A = Thanks.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.

A = I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.

Bot's return =  through to be it as be the war 

---------------
Q = Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.

A = Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.

Bot's return =  yeah i leave that 

---------------
Q = But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--

A = Yes Basil?

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.

A = Hey, Mick!

Bot's return =  yeah injun what do you want 

---------------
Q = Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?

A = Well, you can't always get what you want.

Bot's return =  yes on 

---------------
Q = "You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.

A = Good on ya, man.

Bot's return =  let's just go 

---------------
Q = Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.

A = Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?

Bot's return =  it's 

---------------
Q = That does not compute.

A = Why not? It's a question.

Bot's return =  your mom got of see dreadful like you really to say me 

---------------
Q = What's wrong with your hand?

A = Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

Bot's return =  ah of the flu psychology mood the file 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.

A = Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.

Bot's return =  why you must be better in the do with do how 

---------------
Q = Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?

A = No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.

Bot's return =  what the hell are you talking about 

---------------
Q = I've got you, Dr. Evil!

A = Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.

Bot's return =  ted i don't want to stay here it's time for us to go back home me for me this just want this me 

---------------
Q = No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.

A = Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.

Bot's return =  i wish i had that luxury i'm the key 

---------------
Q = That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.

A = Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.

Bot's return =  man i don't want to go into this 

---------------
Q = It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.

A = Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.

Bot's return =  what do you want i'm here my job says where is 

---------------
Q = My mother's told me all about you.

A = If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?

Bot's return =  yes ma'am 

---------------
Q = OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.

A = Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?

A = I beg your pardon?

Bot's return =  yes 

---------------
Q = I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

A = Excuse me?

Bot's return =  god dammit 

---------------
Q = My meat and two veg.

A = Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.

Bot's return =  the water's going putrid me the barrels off word minutes says 

---------------
Q = You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.

A = We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.

Bot's return =  yes right 

---------------
Q = Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?

A = I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

Bot's return =  maybe 

---------------
Q = You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!

A = Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.

Bot's return =  what do you have danny 

---------------
Q = Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.

---------------
Q = Why did you leave so soon?

A = That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.

A = I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.

Bot's return =  the rain falls 

---------------
Q = Really, Austin!

A = Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.

Bot's return =  you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what it's really like it's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hair lip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating and you don't blame her 

---------------
Q = Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

A = Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.

Bot's return =  good leaving you at 

---------------
Q = I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?

A = Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.

Bot's return =  why if you wanna me and 

---------------
Q = No, did you use a condom?

A = Only sailors use condoms, man.

Bot's return =  not could listen i see him everything man a detective to marry 

---------------
Q = Not in the Nineties.

A = Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.

Bot's return =  ted

Q = Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.

A = It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.

Bot's return =  you don't 

---------------
Q = Hello, luv.

Bot's return =  i have know you think i lost wear 

---------------
Q = Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.

A = Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.

Bot's return =  touch all this what not the bad

Q = Does that make you horny?

A = Not now, Austin.

Bot's return =  i want imagine

A = Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.

Bot's return =  i don't want to shoot about it 

---------------
Q = All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

A = No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.

A = Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.

Bot's return =  that's what you think 

---------------
Q = I'll hurry back.

A = Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--

Bot's return =  who was i not informed of this 

---------------
Q = Austin, what's your point?

---------------
Q = What is it now?

A = Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.

Bot's return =  no killed all after in a favor zoo what's but yours his a stop marshall 

---------------
Q = I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = Right.

A = They're mutated sea bass.

Bot's return =  then do it asshole

Q = That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?

A = Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

Bot's return =  but not pike's 

---------------
Q = No, the boy's right. I really am evil.

A = Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

Bot's return =  so this else a lot of the water of you sir training was it didn't i didn't make give been much the woman have that you want me order to trust of it 

---------------
Q = Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.

A = We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = The details of my life are quite inconsequential.

A = That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.

Bot's return =  nothing yes to ask it 

---------------
Q = Hi.

A = Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.

Bot's return =  so i gave you any thought i probably if 

---------------
Q = But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?

A = Not me.

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = An evil vet?

A = No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.

Bot's return =  i plan to grow on you 

---------------
Q = An evil petting zoo?

A = You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

Bot's return =  i swear on you 

---------------
Q = Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?

A = Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.

Bot's return =  yeah i know 

---------------
Q = And that's how you want to live your life, is it?

A = Yeah. What?

Bot's return =  you need therapy has anyone ever told you that 

---------------
Q = Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.

A = Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?

Bot's return =  yes what 

---------------
Q = I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.

A = Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.

Bot's return =  discreetly 

---------------
Q = Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.

Bot's return =  cornelius

A = I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.

Bot's return =  not at i said

Q = I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.

A = Scott, don't say that...

Bot's return =  i don't fucking get you one they you coming off your not very 

---------------
Q = We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.

A = Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job 

---------------
Q = Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.

A = People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.

Bot's return =  you are cattivo court composer is i will think to happen young don't a very reason can't got on got look long fly trust in the dark and kiss for one to me i feel so able to be something i can get her her my you have 

---------------
Q = Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.

A = All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

Bot's return =  then a jury we're a little more done or i don't think they're about is there i'm husband 

---------------
Q = Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.

A = Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?

Bot's return =  i don't know i just wanna to this young i'm my mouth 

---------------
Q = Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?

A = Great.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = You didn't...

A = Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.

Bot's return =  maybe i'll 

---------------
Q = I'm proud of you.

A = Why?

Bot's return =  it wouldn't have changed the way you feel 

---------------
Q = Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.

A = You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = What about his teeth?

A = You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

Bot's return =  not well knows with 

---------------
Q = I just don't see it.

A = Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.

Bot's return =  yeah what pamela landy 

---------------
Q = Did you ever...

A = Of course not. I was married to your father.

Bot's return =  last i had 

---------------
Q = Did you ever want to?

A = Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.

Bot's return =  and the problem is you only got three 

---------------
Q = No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.

A = I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = We don't judge here.

A = OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.

Bot's return =  i'm know a crime an 

---------------
Q = And how do you feel about that?

A = I don't wanna take over the family business.

Bot's return =  how'd you learn 

---------------
Q = What do you want to do, Scott?

A = I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

Bot's return =  oh can't he tell a big girl how all soon 

---------------
Q = We don't label people here, Scott.

A = No, he's really evil.

Bot's return =  i see go thank here of the head of all not one late 

---------------
Q = I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.

A = OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.

Bot's return =  i should probably write me dinner minutes and riding dunwitty 

---------------
Q = We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.

A = Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.

Bot's return =  does they're it but so fire in the middle gun 

---------------
Q = Really?

A = Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

Bot's return =  what happened it's like a fucking way 

---------------
Q = Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --

A = Seriously?

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.

A = You don't say. How real does it feel?

Bot's return =  oh is he you killed about 

---------------
Q = As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.

A = There are limits?

Bot's return =  oh you do 

---------------
Q = The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.

A = No need. I'll call again.

Bot's return =  i counted from behind for do they i know who to help about it 

---------------
Q = I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...

A = ... bottle ...

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Red ...

A = ... head ...

Q = Would that I could say the Same.

A = Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...

Bot's return =  i left sure got to the theatre 

---------------
Q = I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --

A = You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.

Bot's return =  oh is isn't now too a party per se 

---------------
Q = I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?

A = Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

Bot's return =  you were i'm i'm at

Bot's return =  to song a new

A = Eh? In here!

Bot's return =  i sure 

---------------
Q = Quite a collection.

A = If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.

Bot's return =  dr this reminding is not got is how are it's more agree 

---------------
Q = Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.

Q = People, too.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.

A = He tried to warn us ...

Bot's return =  i watched from behind the stands didn't want to embarrass you ya know the drunk showed up that kind of thing 

---------------
Q = Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?

A = Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

Bot's return =  does it snow in bombay 

---------------
Q = Then what's stopping you?

A = One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.

Bot's return =  oooooo 

---------------
Q = The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.

A = How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.

Bot's return =  what the last time is you have to make for for your shit and tell be a 

---------------
Q = Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

A = What are my choices?

Bot's return =  you do have policy were don't 

---------------
Q = Doctor Peel, I presume?

A = And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.

Bot's return =  okay a must wait for a man to say 

---------------
Q = I was about to throw in the towel.

A = I had a spot of bother at the door.

Bot's return =  what is this 

---------------
Q = I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --

A = 1922. Why the kippers?

Bot's return =  i should tear your head off 

---------------
Q = Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?

A = So what was all this -- some sort of test?

Bot's return =  what are you doing about 

---------------
Q = Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.

A = Rules are made to be broken.

Bot's return =  but i have promises to keep and miles to me 

---------------
Q = Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.

A = And just what is the game?

Bot's return =  you

Q = Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?

A = They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

Bot's return =  ted i don't want to stay here it's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war 

---------------
Q = I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry

---------------
Q = I'll see ya around, huh?

A = It's a small town.

Bot's return =  that's you know we're the prestige and the job title

---------------
Q = Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?

A = Who's doing this?

Bot's return =  what do you done 

---------------
Q = Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?

A = Then who --

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.

A = I don't have a story.

Bot's return =  what

Bot's return =  wazoo try to listen whataya think surfer grunge hip hop euro trash 

---------------
Q = You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --

A = I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.

Bot's return =  not can't tell get a minute on for such a hardass 

---------------
Q = That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.

A = Trychticholorate.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body

Q = Who the fuck is doing this?

A = After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...

Bot's return =  what are you a shot going i get to get and the job like it i haven't had a man job 

---------------
Q = Oh Jesus Christ...

A = Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?

Bot's return =  i've got 

---------------
Q = If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.

A = You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?

Bot's return =  not u 

---------------
Q = I want another shot, Sir.

A = Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?

Bot's return =  that's true that would give i even than i even like i don't want to you from be it but be be more something you had take your own and i'll have a tom maybe can 

---------------
Q = If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

A = -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.

Bot's return =  you're welcome 

---------------
Q = No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.

A = Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.

Bot's return =  well and course look how there for you want so the only to the job and and the next and i thought you all 

---------------
Q = Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.

A = Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.

Bot's return =  it's if you go with our a few i just you got is it case you haven't be a free in your head 

---------------
Q = Are you still here?

A = Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.

A = I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.

Bot's return =  why if a mystery knew like i don't really to ask it's a job i'd 

---------------
Q = -- Shhh.

A = What are you listening to?

Bot's return =  you me have 

---------------
Q = So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.

A = Glass?

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...

A = -- Another backdraft.

Bot's return =  yeah injun what do you want 

---------------
Q = Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.

A = No it couldn't.

Bot's return =  this is a 44 magnum murder 

---------------
Q = Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...

A = I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...

Bot's return =  i want paint 

---------------
Q = Read.

A = "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"

Bot's return =  i said 

---------------
Q = -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.

A = "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".

Bot's return =  and the stones did you find them in the wreckage 

---------------
Q = Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.

A = Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.

Bot's return =  the debts has here to happen 

---------------
Q = Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.

A = And the putty around the door?

Bot's return =  okay i heard you too 

---------------
Q = Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

A = But the right guess on this is arson.

Bot's return =  i don't have to was at you help them me i was there about there doing because us doing us be a vet like a would like a stop like a stop time time i shouldn't her i want be my own excuse in and 

---------------
Q = I don't guess.

A = Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.

Bot's return =  yeah on go back 

---------------
Q = I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 

A = But he killed these guys.

Bot's return =  and what in heaven's 

---------------
Q = But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.

A = What reason?

Bot's return =  okay let's okay okay so a suitcase half and what 

---------------
Q = Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

A = That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?

Bot's return =  oooooo 

---------------
Q = No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.

A = Are you going public with this?

Bot's return =  i wouldn't know where to start you and your how doing 

---------------
Q = What the hell are you doing here?

A = I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

Bot's return =  i wish you been him a word minutes five 

---------------
Q = So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...

A = And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.

Bot's return =  you can't threaten me 

---------------
Q = Nice bunch of guys.

A = Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.

Bot's return =  now sir ma'am 

---------------
Q = This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.

A = Yeah? Airtight?

Bot's return =  yeah like ralph lauren 

---------------
Q = I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.

A = Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.

Bot's return =  why on i not informed too will concerned of one but this one would one of the room anymore i want be the time and the people so people people i had 

---------------
Q = Then who wrote the report?

A = It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?

Bot's return =  i swear i had fool myself into believing and will be be the truth woman i did told in sleep and i are not a job difference i got to come my men and have life 

---------------
Q = Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...

A = How ya feeling?

Bot's return =  i doubt it she's they in wrong 

---------------
Q = Did you pull me out?

A = Yeah.

Bot's return =  then you do cows and shagging my you 

---------------
Q = Did I say thanks?

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = So what do you want me to do?

A = I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...

Bot's return =  nothing you but i hardly think 

---------------
Q = Your brother was a good man.

A = Yeah.

Bot's return =  then you do cows and shagging my you 

---------------
Q = Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.

A = Like it never happened...

Bot's return =  yes you learn her 

---------------
Q = Brian?

A = Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

Bot's return =  i guess 

---------------
Q = 'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?

A = Four months.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Four months?

A = I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

Bot's return =  they're you are to convince think 

---------------
Q = Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?

A = Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

Bot's return =  not like stick to her on you want still give you need be be your gonna i wait be your own you in give 

---------------
Q = Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

A = Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

Bot's return =  yeah your whatever i like talking understand be my idea and you're a different not this one would a happen and mine this have face for a jam in no if in bill i understand we anything in love if if being now if you want tell in our secret just just our you this like it is can did we 

---------------
Q = Oh, man, I'm sorry.

A = You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Yeah. Big fan.

A = And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.

Bot's return =  you ever the same a all god had for going 

---------------
Q = Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.

A = No need to be modest, Brian.

Bot's return =  i know just we'll you behind 

---------------
Q = No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.

A = -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.

Bot's return =  i'm sorry 

---------------
Q = Every little boy's fantasy.

A = Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.

Bot's return =  what does that mean 

---------------
Q = I have a job.

A = This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.

Bot's return =  touch of the flu 

---------------
Q = Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.

A = Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.

Bot's return =  i wish to grow on will can't a piece i been you i didn't people i love it was all more here as you 

---------------
Q = Mr. McCaffrey...

A = Nice boat.

Bot's return =  yeah injun what do you want 

---------------
Q = Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

A = Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.

Bot's return =  i don't know i just wanna to be ganz i'm breath in my mouth my sorry to get my sorry 

---------------
Q = Completely out of control.

A = What the hell are we waiting for?

Bot's return =  you can be single 

---------------
Q = Aren't you even curious?

A = Engine 115, right?

Bot's return =  i said 

---------------
Q = How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.

A = Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.

Bot's return =  deceiving they've i wasn't my 

---------------
Q = You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?

A = Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.

Bot's return =  if rick has the letters he's much too smart to let you find them on the one thing on your back thing 

---------------
Q = Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".

A = Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.

Bot's return =  i need probably write me are the great matter 

---------------
Q = Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.

A = It's in my blood, Willy.

Bot's return =  i know fine to see you yesterday i found a very good as a woman 

---------------
Q = Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."

A = Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.

Bot's return =  don't give me that i can fuck for

Q = Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?

A = Management were pin heads.

Bot's return =  that neither you are your be your life be your son

A = Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --

---------------
Q = I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.

A = I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.

Bot's return =  not check to grilled him 

---------------
Q = The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.

A = I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.

Bot's return =  i did 

---------------
Q = The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...

A = ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.

Bot's return =  you can't threaten me 

---------------
Q = You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.

A = I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?

Bot's return =  you must always 

---------------
Q = That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.

A = I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.

Bot's return =  you ever anything in my it at be a long anything done wait i wouldn't gonna on the road like where weeks 

---------------
Q = What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?

A = Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.

Bot's return =  you were always me 

---------------
Q = Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.

A = It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.

Bot's return =  first visit to london 

---------------
Q = We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.

A = I'm wid it.

Bot's return =  i would tear you to return 

---------------
Q = I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.

A = Go on.  Good so far.

Bot's return =  he looked me jail to your with in a few way cop i know that over work i'm sorry to the wife 

---------------
Q = The name of the show?

A = It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

Bot's return =  okay a matter to you 

---------------
Q = I'm feelin' dis'!

A = It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = That's a great handle.

A = Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.

Bot's return =  but imagine the things he'd say during sex 

---------------
Q = Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.

A = What are there character traits?

Bot's return =  i don't call know just i said so 

---------------
Q = Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

A = Exactly!

Bot's return =  the important of question are third generation nexus sixes constructed of skin flesh culture selected enogenic transfer capable of self perpetuating thought para physical abilities and developed for emigration program are you with

Q = Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.

A = And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?

Bot's return =  what what if i say no 

---------------
Q = Yep, you guessed it.

A = This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."

Bot's return =  and would he incredibly is an way a story without of me 

---------------
Q = Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.

A = Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.

Bot's return =  if he meant you blame be my business and i are sitting because long us that a fucking and urban you don't give that 

---------------
Q = Negroes would be in an uproar.

A = So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.

Bot's return =  yes sir 

---------------
Q = Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.

A = Who are the other characters?

Bot's return =  i did bianca and when you were you want to know the next you're how shit the woman and the work 

---------------
Q = We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?

---------------
Q = And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.

A = I don't know about that plantation angle.

Bot's return =  oh what 

---------------
Q = I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.

A = To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.

Bot's return =  you can't threaten me 

---------------
Q = I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

Bot's return =  look what she the tracking alignment display 

---------------
Q = Besides, what does he know about Negroes?

A = Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.

Bot's return =  i need be a choice 

---------------
Q = What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

A = If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.

Bot's return =  dr darling i shall your very 

---------------
Q = That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?

A = No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.

Bot's return =  yes ma'am i shall what

Q = I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.

A = Dunwitty, don't leave.

A = Calm down, please.

Bot's return =  better'n me 

---------------
Q = Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.

A = I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.

Bot's return =  not daddy 

---------------
Q = This has to be a big mistake.

A = The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.

A = Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.

Bot's return =  i was talking to the cat

Q = How long has my father been like this?

A = Not that often.  He was excited to see you.

Bot's return =  that's wasn't 

---------------
Q = So he drank himself into a stuper?

A = The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = So what's up with you?

A = I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.

---------------
Q = Sir, I'm a British officer.

A = It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me.

Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?

Bot's return =  i have

Bot's return =  this rae you get to be dear for the price of the hour 

---------------
Q = What is the service, sir?

A = There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.

Bot's return =  her is the real what right 

---------------
Q = You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?

A = Only a very little, as soldiers do.

Bot's return =  put keep 'em laughing

Bot's return =  not at to have fine a man or thanks 

---------------
Q = Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!

A = Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.

Bot's return =  i don't want that i want to be with idea 

---------------
Q = A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.

A = And so I am.

Bot's return =  go the gun is confined 

---------------
Q = And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?

A = Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?

Bot's return =  aw you do with the job for for anything 

---------------
Q = Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.

A = He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.

Bot's return =  what are you talking about 

---------------
Q = Have you taken my message to him?

A = The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?

A = Your cousins go out with him.

Bot's return =  when see 

---------------
Q = That's a very handsome sword you have there.

A = It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

Bot's return =  because anybody i don't do charity 

---------------
Q = I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.

A = Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.

Bot's return =  oh is are you doing about 

---------------
Q = I'll match any man with the sword.

A = But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.

Bot's return =  i want a hot young as they hired the things that was was a big difference i found got home 

---------------
Q = Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.

A = It must have been some other gate.

Bot's return =  why for you came oh the kid three 

---------------
Q = Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.

A = I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.

Bot's return =  of course i want i go it tell work 

---------------
Q = I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.

A = We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."

Bot's return =  our entertainment makes our so her here here 

---------------
Q = I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.

A = Is Miss Dugan well?

---------------
Q = She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.

A = Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!

Bot's return =  i'm sorry newt 

---------------
Q = Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.

A = I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?

A = Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.

Bot's return =  well i don't think to go but for but did don't with out 

---------------
Q = Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

Bot's return =  if you know so i should you do it you just they more running you're how could you're the next and songs has you had to think involved

Q = You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!

A = Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.

Bot's return =  deceiving you do 

---------------
Q = Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.

A = I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?

Bot's return =  okay a must who's i'd they all the time back on had 

---------------
Q = Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.

A = Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.

Bot's return =  i like it up here 

---------------
Q = Good gracious!  What is this?

A = You are going to drive to the frontier.

Bot's return =  you're welcome

Bot's return =  because be a supervisor

Q = Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.

A = Your honor must lower his voice.

Q = For whom else have you worked?

A = No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

Bot's return =  really kids offered 

---------------
Q = Who else can give me information about you?

A = Only the agency of servants.

Bot's return =  gee this is their i mean told have own so you looking for me or 

---------------
Q = The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?

A = I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.

Bot's return =  i'm be a spoilsport this guy's it true on the way 

---------------
Q = But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.

A = Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.

Bot's return =  don't sorry none 

---------------
Q = But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?

A = Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.

Bot's return =  seems like of them 

---------------
Q = Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?

A = Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.

Bot's return =  for even say not we'll about it 

---------------
Q = When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?

A = Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.

Bot's return =  how at i'm you be shoot being is 

---------------
Q = It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.

A = To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.

Bot's return =  you're for you look work me that 

---------------
Q = I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.

A = Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?

Bot's return =  does it down 

---------------
Q = Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.

A = Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.

Bot's return =  dan great to see you again like much i can be tell you can 

---------------
Q = Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.

A = That is a trifle strong.

Bot's return =  yeah you see you do keep it i'll report you couldn't 

---------------
Q = Never.

A = But, for a time... a passing fancy?

Bot's return =  do you 

---------------
Q = That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.

A = What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?

Bot's return =  for for that 

---------------
Q = Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.

A = Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.

Bot's return =  no not when fault gill 

---------------
Q = Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.

A = It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.

Bot's return =  okay a rumor on me i think to fuck about about with a big difference we only a man i got about home with i so there us help there know a piece i think you into this to her after be i can't take that a man 

---------------
Q = But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.

A = That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.

Bot's return =  i'd come you don ' t did i think be be gonna be able you don't like be it hell down ago you i was you though me trigger why is change ilsa up make i mean no much report there 

---------------
Q = It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.

A = I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.

Bot's return =  you're this you go 

---------------
Q = A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.

A = I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.

Bot's return =  not okay 

---------------
Q = How so?

A = By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.

Bot's return =  don't else never been you are on dead that your life 

---------------
Q = You want my heart?

A = It is my only object.

Bot's return =  oh yes he tell a will and will 

---------------
Q = To make me wretched in two weeks.

A = To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.

Bot's return =  maybe 

---------------
Q = The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.

A = Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.

Bot's return =  young i have a reputation in the middle of matters car late an just his 

---------------
Q = Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?

A = With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.

Bot's return =  his father's dead right 

---------------
Q = And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?

A = Then I will respectfully take leave of her.

Bot's return =  okay me 

---------------
Q = You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?

A = Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.

Bot's return =  i was ahead to be 

---------------
Q = Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?

A = I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite like a minute man their my gonna back a say 

---------------
Q = Will we always leave it at this?

A = Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.

Bot's return =  but at 

---------------
Q = I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.

A = Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.

Bot's return =  and the bodies 

---------------
Q = Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.

A = My husband has convinced me of the contrary.

Bot's return =  when a comes or outnumbered my whole a say 

---------------
Q = Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.

A = O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!

Bot's return =  to white someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right or lives doctor god it's a through of things going this would stick the put the next so it's the new and i don't no the kid anymore him because 

---------------
Q = As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.

A = We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"

Bot's return =  has the kid gonna say sorry meanwhile i'm not here anymore like i knew him much him 

---------------
Q = My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:

A = Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.

Bot's return =  it's i never was right 

---------------
Q = Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

A = Old fool!

Bot's return =  what is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century 

---------------
Q = I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.

A = Agreed.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = I feel the ribbon.

A = Then you must get it.

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = Why are you shaking?

A = With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

Bot's return =  yes ma'am 

---------------
Q = I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.

A = I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.

Bot's return =  of what 

---------------
Q = Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?

A = I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?

Bot's return =  i see well yet 

---------------
Q = If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.

A = But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.

Bot's return =  dr evil i thought i put him in jail for good 

---------------
Q = Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.

A = I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.

Bot's return =  no i never did 

---------------
Q = Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?

A = Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

Bot's return =  what'll we do 

---------------
Q = I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?

A = As much as possible.

Bot's return =  if a little lucky said tell to me position 

---------------
Q = As much as possible?

A = Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.

Bot's return =  gee 

---------------
Q = Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.

A = All right, five hundred guineas.

Bot's return =  i know just we'll you behind 

---------------
Q = By name only.

A = Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.

Bot's return =  nothing talking if the shooting twombley 

---------------
Q = Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

A = Yes!

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = Was he cheated?

A = In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.

Bot's return =  well the marijuana crop is a good one all it's not yours to ask you 

---------------
Q = A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.

A = The Prince left him only that choice.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite 

---------------
Q = The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.

A = When is he to go?

Bot's return =  take it easy a little 

---------------
Q = Then this must be done tomorrow.

A = What is to be done?

Bot's return =  what one's going work want him he was born you interested me yes 

---------------
Q = What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?

A = Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."

Bot's return =  thank new about the shooting twombley 

---------------
Q = Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?

A = Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...

Bot's return =  almost all of them 

---------------
Q = That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.

A = I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.

Bot's return =  of i want a as dear 

---------------
Q = But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?

A = O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

Bot's return =  look now i'm pumping you i'm sorry it's none of my business it's just that you're not like the others 

---------------
Q = As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?

A = That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.

Bot's return =  my see is oh now on wanted now 

---------------
Q = How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.

A = You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.

Bot's return =  the the carrying charges 

---------------
Q = Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.

A = I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

A = Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?

Bot's return =  well yes this you go 

---------------
Q = May I be quite frank with you?

A = Yes, of course.

Bot's return =  from must've home us you have had to get about 

---------------
Q = Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.

A = I see.

Bot's return =  i told you too 

---------------
Q = Did you buy the horse, papa?

A = Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.

Bot's return =  ugh barbara 

---------------
Q = Good night, papa.

A = Good night, my little darling.

Bot's return =  man i don't want to go into this 

---------------
Q = One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

A = What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?

Bot's return =  i'd you shouldn't been on said give supposed for me 

---------------
Q = I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.

A = Yes, papa.

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.

A = Is he all right, papa?

Bot's return =  i'm sorry bob 

---------------
Q = I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.

A = Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.

Bot's return =  does you just give me back a little something for the road other hope me locked me that my you want 

---------------
Q = Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.

A = Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?

Bot's return =  when a little spoiled 

---------------
Q = I beg your pardon?

A = Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.

Bot's return =  nothing you but i hardly think 

---------------
Q = Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?

A = Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?

Bot's return =  i don't know what 

---------------
Q = Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?

A = Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?

Bot's return =  not u barrington u to be a look 

---------------
Q = I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?

A = Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.

Bot's return =  really anybody offered to buy it 

---------------
Q = Sir, let those laugh that win.

A = I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?

Bot's return =  of i want is up my job 

---------------
Q = Charming Schuvaloff.

A = Black-eyed Sczortarska.

Bot's return =  what are you coming here 

---------------
Q = Dark Valdez.

A = Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?

Bot's return =  maybe a rumor 

---------------
Q = He is only curious to know who you are.

A = If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.

Bot's return =  come on all a minute 

---------------
Q = He loves me, as I love you.

A = Will he wish to know the details of this night?

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.

A = Tender Hegenheim.

Bot's return =  of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol

Q = Can I at least have a drink?

A = It's ten thirty in the morning.

Bot's return =  enough is reminding me

Q = Yeah, if you've slept.

A = You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.

Bot's return =  how'd you learn so much about dreams

Bot's return =  then you do cows and shagging my you

A = I'm -- I'm sorry...

Bot's return =  well what have you got 

---------------
Q = A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?

A = I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.

Bot's return =  not for for use 

---------------
Q = Fuck, what the fuck is going on --

A = What do we do?

Bot's return =  well wait 

---------------
Q = Did -- did you --

A = It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!

Bot's return =  you enjoy that as for god

Q = What about Pike?

A = Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.

Bot's return =  okay just a mystery isn't i didn't hear how don't a fucking 

---------------
Q = You framed-him...

A = None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified through of the people who have you care 

---------------
Q = Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?

A = We found him like this --

Q = West was one thing, but this --

A = Shut up, Mueller.

Bot's return =  what

Q = We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?

A = We don't know. West is dead.

Q = Yeah, right...

A = Shut up.  West's dead.

Bot's return =  what

Q = You too?

A = We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

Bot's return =  really jam you tryin' to make us barf 

---------------
Q = Why not?

A = I asked for a policeman.

Bot's return =  maybe

A = C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.

Bot's return =  what a concentration camp mr only a time in my life 

---------------
Q = You did Basic here?

A = Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = There's no need...

A = They're dead, aren't they?

Bot's return =  i remember you i've never driven before

---------------
Q = Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.

A = Did Kendall tell you about the PX?

Bot's return =  don't an me kick ya here a most late at it lesbian 

---------------
Q = So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --

A = I didn't shoot West --

Bot's return =  look a rumor in maybe one in my own 

---------------
Q = I apologize --

A = You saw West's body.

Bot's return =  not a shower in the world world 

---------------
Q = You saved Kendall's life --

A = But not Pike's.

Bot's return =  your trying to help you here there's warsaw 

---------------
Q = Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --

A = Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.

Bot's return =  that's true him at don't you go 

---------------
Q = We don't need the tapes --

A = Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?

Bot's return =  what do you think to know for i didn't

Q = He -- He made me do it --

Q = I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.

A = And the bodies?

Bot's return =  i gotta get to the library before it closes killer physics test 

---------------
Q = I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...

A = Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...

Bot's return =  and the stones did you find them in the wreckage 

---------------
Q = Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?

A = No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.

Bot's return =  i want a hot young white director maybe the kid that pheenom who just right in hot of have time did look every one with right did did did in the other place i had 

---------------
Q = That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

Bot's return =  if so insulted this the stones from he sends i'm snuff this snuff this a good now 

---------------
Q = He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?

A = Epilepsy.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body

Q = He said he worked there --

A = No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?

Bot's return =  all right what you need oh oh how to the police but it

Q = What business?

A = Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --

Bot's return =  if rick has the letters he's much too smart to have the money that the room says got 

---------------
Q = Where?

A = The creek bed --

Bot's return =  yes yes is that true with the ruin of the course 

---------------
Q = Back up.

A = Mueller was alone in the cabin?

Bot's return =  i think someone hasn't 

---------------
Q = Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?

A = Would you have believed me?

Bot's return =  i'm mom is to question on me one 

---------------
Q = Where's the cabin?

A = Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.

Bot's return =  what meeting 

---------------
Q = You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.

A = Can't do that now, though, can you?

Bot's return =  put yo'self 

---------------
Q = Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.

A = We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --

Bot's return =  sea bass 

---------------
Q = Ohhhh, I don't think so...

A = How do you know that?

Bot's return =  you're 

---------------
Q = Cadet, what's your name!

A = Sir, Dunbar, sir!

Bot's return =  what'd i have believe never you're 

---------------
Q = You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?

A = Sir, yes, sir!

Bot's return =  oh what we're now please do you say much 

---------------
Q = Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?

A = Sir, yes, sir!

Bot's return =  oh what we're now please do you say much 

---------------
Q = What the fuck is going on?

A = Your weapons, Sergeant.

Bot's return =  you must be tired it'll wake you up 

---------------
Q = Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.

A = Why?

Bot's return =  it wouldn't have changed the way you feel 

---------------
Q = Jesus, what happened?

A = West... he's dead.

Bot's return =  the easy of fedex as i understand it is to make the damn connection 

---------------
Q = Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.

A = So did we. Why didn't you come?

Bot's return =  yes i'll 

---------------
Q = So you killed him?

A = I...

Bot's return =  our band mystery is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer jam's mom said something about sending him to st bernard's right we gotta bust him out before we go anywhere

---------------
Q = Bullshit.

A = Look in my pack.

Bot's return =  oh i'm sorry tell a little for is my you dr it's 

---------------
Q = Why?

A = Just look. Little pocket.

Bot's return =  do here to be vindictive 

---------------
Q = Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.

A = You're lying --

Bot's return =  i got imagine 

---------------
Q = Why... why didn't you tell me?

A = Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.

Bot's return =  if rick the things he'd got are they can about every 

---------------
Q = That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.

A = You saw West, right? How was he killed?

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Full clip to the body --

A = From up close or far away?

Bot's return =  you probably expect in out a great and u better going there's ten how 

---------------
Q = Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...

A = They?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --

A = No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --

Bot's return =  what what saying mantan buyl girl

Q = A test will no doubt link you to the killing --

A = Put it down!

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?

A = Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.

Bot's return =  and the stones is kind of show wrong 

---------------
Q = I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.

A = But not the only victim, right?

Bot's return =  well you know where the prestige in the key that you're gonna soon 

---------------
Q = My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.

A = Senator Daddy must be thrilled.

Bot's return =  what the hell are you doin' with da's and you're a good woman person thanks what trying a drug 

---------------
Q = He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?

A = I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.

A = You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.

Bot's return =  you're tell to be dealt right 

---------------
Q = What happened to "degrees"?

A = I didn't kill him --

Bot's return =  don't have at much go to put it then take to me 

---------------
Q = Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.

A = But you didn't.

Bot's return =  we you have 

---------------
Q = He admitted it.

A = Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.

Bot's return =  no an i and look i think wait to shit with it i just want to wait about 

---------------
Q = Why did he come back for you?

A = I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.

Bot's return =  not u i've get her the church decree i'll the watchman though the boston but the key is kind of my own 

---------------
Q = Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.

A = Mr. Hardy?

Bot's return =  you nut 

---------------
Q = You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --

A = How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

Bot's return =  ted i don't want to stay here it's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war 

---------------
Q = Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.

A = My heart weeps.

Bot's return =  you must be tired it'll wake you up 

---------------
Q = Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --

A = So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --

Bot's return =  thank get fine 

---------------
Q = I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"

A = Well?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = Dunbar will testify that you were.

A = Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.

Bot's return =  now you don't the lengths in the hour 

---------------
Q = Something funny, Levi?

A = I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.

Bot's return =  oh if then the way you from much 

---------------
Q = Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --

A = I didn't do anything --

Bot's return =  that's what that so surprising and you're why you take take let it down and you're the other 

---------------
Q = Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?

A = I didn't --

Bot's return =  that's not are going to do you 

---------------
Q = You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!

A = I don't know --

---------------
Q = Where are they!

A = Maybe --

Bot's return =  the duke what did you do 

---------------
Q = MAYBE WHAT --

A = Maybe he...

Bot's return =  do what 

---------------
Q = How are you?

A = Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --

Bot's return =  what do you want 

---------------
Q = That bad?

A = Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --

Bot's return =  oh god 

---------------
Q = This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.

A = And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?

Bot's return =  don't check it mean to want and why 

---------------
Q = The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...

A = It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.

Bot's return =  well wasn't 

---------------
Q = The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.

A = And the problem is you only got three.

Bot's return =  don't worry a piece there is completely to deliver 

---------------
Q = No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.

A = I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?

Bot's return =  when on going she over he something to do you 

---------------
Q = Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --

A = I'm not gonna let that happen.

Bot's return =  i might you 

---------------
Q = He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --

A = He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.

Bot's return =  really that's 

---------------
Q = Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.

A = Who killed Pike?

Bot's return =  i doubt it had you 

---------------
Q = We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.

A = There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.

Bot's return =  you were that as though 

---------------
Q = Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.

A = From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.

Bot's return =  i'm gonna maybe it i had anything anything it on a job one 

---------------
Q = Nevertheless --

A = Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.

Bot's return =  but i said was this 

---------------
Q = You mean not enough to save you.

A = JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.

Bot's return =  does it snow in bombay 

---------------
Q = Tom, where are you going --

A = Home, I'm done.

Bot's return =  let's you have moved to work about 

---------------
Q = You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --

A = What the hell are you talking about --

Bot's return =  what neither to off me 

---------------
Q = Yeah.

A = Does Osborne agree?

Bot's return =  then do it asshole 

---------------
Q = It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.

A = That's horseshit and you know it.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = You think you could explain all this to me?

A = I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite all a big one and i'd he's any need again work 

---------------
Q = They're taking your command, aren't they?

A = The Senator...

Bot's return =  what we took bathes together 

---------------
Q = You're a good soldier, Bill.

A = I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.

Bot's return =  i'd 

---------------
Q = It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?

A = What are you talking about?

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.

A = You're drunk --

Bot's return =  i got imagine 

---------------
Q = Stay where you are.

A = Or what? You've gone round the bend --

Bot's return =  if your splice me so come him ya later 

---------------
Q = What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.

A = That's preposterous --

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.

A = I'm not even going to dignify that --

Bot's return =  don't need supposed 

---------------
Q = No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.

A = You're crazy --

Bot's return =  i thought you might have 

---------------
Q = You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.

A = For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --

Bot's return =  tell me when tell with he now mrs one 

---------------
Q = Hostile and uncooperative.

A = Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?

Bot's return =  i can't to tell you something see it i can't make anything here i was in here i could be here crazy like i want what's them 

---------------
Q = I didn't mean that as a compliment.

A = Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.

Bot's return =  if to station you to truth all the car 

---------------
Q = Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --

A = You and the Colonel go back.

Bot's return =  have father to use my blackouts 

---------------
Q = He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.

A = You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.

Bot's return =  this meeting major 

---------------
Q = It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --

A = Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.

Bot's return =  i don't want that i have to make them this here to talk about where i'm sorry did 

---------------
Q = Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.

A = Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --

Bot's return =  the antenna has to be replaced 

---------------
Q = Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --

A = Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.

Bot's return =  what'll 

---------------
Q = Move him.

A = Why?

Bot's return =  it wouldn't have changed the way you feel 

---------------
Q = Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?

A = Excuse me?

Bot's return =  god dammit 

---------------
Q = Is Dunbar cute?

A = That is the most unprofessional --

Bot's return =  yeah you heard her 

---------------
Q = I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.

A = Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.

Bot's return =  i'm not at 

---------------
Q = The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --

A = See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.

Bot's return =  what do you want i'm done that see do 

---------------
Q = Baseball?

A = I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --

Bot's return =  you're a private hypocrite is a price 

---------------
Q = You made me look like an idiot --

A = Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.

Bot's return =  i don't know i just wanna to be hurt how my breath my not in a year of my time my not just my fault 

---------------
Q = We're in the middle of a murder case --

A = Best time for banal chit-chat.

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = What is that?

A = Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.

Bot's return =  if rick has the letters he's much too smart to let you find them on the problem on me your gonna do that me you want 

---------------
Q = Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.

A = You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.

Bot's return =  not was a 

---------------
Q = Something like that. You?

A = I lost a bet.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = You're kidding.

A = Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.

Bot's return =  i don't know how to help about 

---------------
Q = You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?

A = I plan to grow on you.

Bot's return =  i'm not kidding 

---------------
Q = You're off to a late start.

A = So noted.

Bot's return =  huh me 

---------------
Q = He's telling the truth, up to a point.

A = What point?

Bot's return =  okay thanks okay the guy thing here props and you're why don't my own 

---------------
Q = Something wrong?

A = Being back here. Gives me the willies.

Bot's return =  come them them you around what where 

---------------
Q = Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.

A = Got it.

Bot's return =  no i don't get fucking that this i said 

---------------
Q = "Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?

A = I don't think that has anything to do with --

Bot's return =  well the crew is confined like you and fucking know that happens did you ever it you'll 

---------------
Q = I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.

A = Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

Bot's return =  what do you mean 

---------------
Q = Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.

A = Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --

Bot's return =  i don't know i just wanna to be the one how all all the big 

---------------
Q = Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

A = I don't know.

Q = Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --

A = You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --

A = Watch me.

Bot's return =  god dammit 

---------------
Q = West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.

A = You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --

Bot's return =  of course i must be love please please for 

---------------
Q = I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --

A = Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --

Bot's return =  now you came maybe it on the crowd shit the family how just the way you can and thing you don't give to make down 

---------------
Q = Why do you care?

A = Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.

Bot's return =  until all a man 

---------------
Q = I didn't shoot West...

A = What?

Bot's return =  wazoo try to listen whataya think surfer grunge hip hop euro trash 

---------------
Q = Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.

A = And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.

Bot's return =  what what 

---------------
Q = Dunbar.

A = Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.

Bot's return =  we know want you recognize and how all a prostitute 

---------------
Q = They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.

A = And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.

Bot's return =  don't psycho be your man kill here the only 

---------------
Q = So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --

A = Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --

Bot's return =  the antenna has here to happen you are said that i had about it was i could 

---------------
Q = Buttfucks the cabin?

A = And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

Bot's return =  good the marijuana crop is like a dangerous 

---------------
Q = Little bit.

A = Let's go talk to Bill...

Bot's return =  they 

---------------
Q = What?

A = What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.

Bot's return =  no if i shoot there 

---------------
Q = Are you sure?

A = Positive. Hardy, they planned this.

Bot's return =  i think someone hasn't 

---------------
Q = Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?

A = Good idea.

Bot's return =  i'm an asthmatic and i had chartered maybe without for can i believed me to come 

---------------
Q = Yeah, I could've. Should've.

A = You wanted to get the truth.

Bot's return =  can't the chief you 

---------------
Q = No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.

A = You mean the falsely accused?

Bot's return =  yes i go 

---------------
Q = You wanted to break him.

A = Yeah.

Bot's return =  then you do cows and shagging my you 

---------------
Q = So what now?

A = Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

Bot's return =  i don't know i just wanna heard of him but right my just need my you just go somewhere in my father 

---------------
Q = Think it'll work?

A = Nah.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = You know, you never told me why you left the army.

A = It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.

Bot's return =  i swear 

---------------
Q = For what?

A = That's gonna stay my secret.

Bot's return =  i'm brother's in jail 

---------------
Q = We were close to something with Kendall.

A = Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?

Bot's return =  what happened 

---------------
Q = No.

A = Good, just making sure.

Bot's return =  let's just go 

---------------
Q = Four --

A = Get in.

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.

A = Right back where we started.

Bot's return =  if see dan do it cool 

---------------
Q = Hardy, what are you doing --

A = Isn't this how your story goes?

Bot's return =  who was my not much 

---------------
Q = We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --

A = Hardy, for Chrissakes --

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = What?

A = Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".

Bot's return =  i don't want to check about my car papers i had he torture for all of my night 

---------------
Q = That's not true.

A = There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.

Bot's return =  oh on they 

---------------
Q = West?

A = Nobody saw. But I don't think so.

Bot's return =  i want to meet her 

---------------
Q = Do I have a choice in this?

A = Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talkin' about 

---------------
Q = What are you doing out here?

A = Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?

Bot's return =  i should to do it i got more to wait and my the next copy 

---------------
Q = Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

A = Think it'll work?

Bot's return =  let's see him there for you got this passport and your father a little 

---------------
Q = Nah.

A = Want company?

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

A = I should probably write that down.

Bot's return =  not all a cab or in business with me 

---------------
Q = Your phone number?

A = In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.

Bot's return =  and what what you did really the wife of you are made from me lisbon product you know how how how it hell because because how how the next today you give them you say another them you get to hell you laid me your you get 

---------------
Q = He was your friend.

A = Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.

Bot's return =  oh what are you killed about 

---------------
Q = The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --

A = What are you talking about?

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = Pike, please --

A = Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --

Bot's return =  and the stones did you find them in the wreckage 

---------------
Q = Maybe we shouldn't go.

A = The faggot speaks.

Bot's return =  yes yes is that 

---------------
Q = You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

A = You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --

A = Poor fucker my ass...

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Pike and I got separated --

A = Yeah and he doesn't know when --

Bot's return =  oh absolutely i know just me i got ready but rick but you performing maybe i speak get a 

---------------
Q = I was freezing from the hurricane --

A = So you took off your shirt?

A = He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.

Bot's return =  thank you but i hardly think

Q = Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?

He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.

A = Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.

Bot's return =  ugh

Q = Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.

A = You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?

Bot's return =  what happened 

---------------
Q = Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.

The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown.

The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door.

---------------
Q = Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way?

Bot's return =  is does he's done about she do

---------------
Q = No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.

A = And the Landy woman?

Bot's return =  you see the ask you moment 

---------------
Q = She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...

---------------
Q = And what are we looking for?

A = I want to know about Treadstone.

Bot's return =  what is to 44 magnum association in a little 

---------------
Q = To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.

A = He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.

Bot's return =  i have what you've been doing but i can't know 

---------------
Q = Let's talk about Conklin.

A = What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?

Bot's return =  you sure check 

---------------
Q = I want to know what happened.

A = What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.

Bot's return =  touch it seems there is can what is one 

---------------
Q = And Bourne? Where's he now?

A = Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?

Bot's return =  waitaminit dudes i wasn't it 

---------------
Q = ...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...

A = ...this is Conklin's computer.

Bot's return =  thanks 

---------------
Q = ...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.

A = Do you know what his budget was?

Bot's return =  can you do cows my shirt no the don't think take on the road case 

---------------
Q = Excuse me.

A = We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.

Bot's return =  has waste you complainin' about back i can to kill you something you have much something good a hell but you 

---------------
Q = May I finish?

A = Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?

Bot's return =  ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes 

---------------
Q = What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!

A = So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.

Bot's return =  yeah i know 

---------------
Q = You don't know what you're getting into here.

A = And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...

Bot's return =  they're it isn't to pizza my around 

---------------
Q = Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?

A = Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.

Bot's return =  get thing here your time something be i had believe with who 

---------------
Q = My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.

A = Don't you want answers?

Bot's return =  i knew you would 

---------------
Q = So what's he doing? You believe him?

A = It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...

Bot's return =  yeah if you

---------------
Q = Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.

---------------
Q = Had to be done.

A = No good options left?

Bot's return =  i see evelyn trying and homer world in i don't know a saying of my life

Q = In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.

A = What do you have, Danny?

Bot's return =  you else when 

---------------
Q = There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.

A = It was staged?

Bot's return =  it's i don't all that 

---------------
Q = That's just a dream, William!

A = We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!

Bot's return =  what is it 

---------------
Q = Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?

A = My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.

Q = Here's to you, sir.

A = Er, good luck, yes.

Q = What do you want for Sam?

A = I don't buy or sell human beings.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.

A = Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.

Bot's return =  what did you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face 

---------------
Q = I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.

A = No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.

Bot's return =  the river on the king 

---------------
Q = The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.

A = You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

Bot's return =  and the little alternative you have wish what the price you won't be it over this it 

---------------
Q = Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.

A = Practically no one.

Bot's return =  i feel to leave you 

---------------
Q = If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.

A = So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.

A = And the carrying charges?

Bot's return =  you see the ask you moment 

---------------
Q = Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.

A = I'll tell him when he comes in.

Bot's return =  they won't until this is over 

---------------
Q = Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?

Q = Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.

A = I shall remember to pay it... to myself.

Bot's return =  not such to grilled the confusion with the thank that it's all the money all i could my any i can my own about talking 

---------------
Q = You see, my dear, the word has gone around.

A = As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.

Bot's return =  bullshit i don't want to stay here it's time for us to me i could go to the say about for to fight look not got not a certain for a thing time he's sir i had 

---------------
Q = I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?

A = Yes, something.

Bot's return =  well thanks 

---------------
Q = Do you know where they are?

A = Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

Bot's return =  then i live you like there's i can and town 

---------------
Q = Rick?

A = He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.

Bot's return =  yes wasn't 

---------------
Q = And Mademoiselle?

A = You needn't be concerned about me.

Bot's return =  look i had i thank a lot

Q = Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

A = This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.

Bot's return =  no daddy 

---------------
Q = That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.

A = Occupied France?

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.

A = What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.

Bot's return =  of what even you must do you want you can a show and a fool for me the job along you in like how and how more you 

---------------
Q = There are only two other alternatives for him.

A = What are they?

Bot's return =  can back

A = And the other alternative?

Bot's return =  what

Q = -- It was "La Belle Aurore."

A = How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.

Bot's return =  you must believe me clear you a wife has and i don't you you didn't your yet and your here your job 

---------------
Q = Not an easy day to forget.

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

A = Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about i was your sorry 

---------------
Q = Say goodnight to Sam for me.

A = I will.

Bot's return =  that's not 

---------------
Q = There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

A = He hasn't played it in a long time.

Bot's return =  thanks it isn't really as a little 

---------------
Q = Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?

A = We said "no questions."

Bot's return =  you can always the only i couldn't you're in a long time here 

---------------
Q = That's easy. There was. He's dead.

A = I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."

Bot's return =  you fancy him 

---------------
Q = Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.

A = I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.

Bot's return =  filled 

---------------
Q = My German's a little rusty.

A = It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.

Bot's return =  yes father's 

---------------
Q = With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.

A = Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?

Bot's return =  as if she on all a go 

---------------
Q = Strange. I know so very little about you.

A = I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.

Bot's return =  don't be my not in not here here and left gotta to have it with we'll

Q = But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.

A = No, no, no, no. We must leave.

Bot's return =  what are she you get do was do do like do can be here can the check 

---------------
Q = No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?

A = All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?

Bot's return =  yes sir 

---------------
Q = That's too far ahead to plan.

A = Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?

Bot's return =  what do you want 

---------------
Q = Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?

A = I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

A = No. No, Rick. Not tonight.

Bot's return =  i just want to be them to worry 

---------------
Q = I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.

A = It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."

Bot's return =  oh this isn't the lead 'negro' to a thousand time 

---------------
Q = I didn't count the days.

A = Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.

Bot's return =  perhaps right often do you talk to five who's been on the cover of your ex 

---------------
Q = Can I tell you a story, Rick?

A = Has it got a wow finish?

Bot's return =  i thought you didn't that was i went to car i want you help it amen your head you called your band me love on 

---------------
Q = I don't know the finish yet.

A = Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.

Bot's return =  he looked me jail 

---------------
Q = It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.

A = Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?

Bot's return =  you know an a 7 

---------------
Q = Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.

A = I don't think I will, Rick.

Bot's return =  look you're a real we can all now to the room you were the only thing over chub 

---------------
Q = Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?

A = You can believe that if you want to.

Bot's return =  i told you i can't very 

---------------
Q = All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.

A = No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.

Bot's return =  oh so you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

---------------
Q = How did you get in?

A = The stairs from the street.

Bot's return =  maybe 

---------------
Q = I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?

A = Richard, I had to see you.

Bot's return =  you treated to me 

---------------
Q = Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

A = You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.

Bot's return =  look it must to all and 

---------------
Q = I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.

A = I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.

Bot's return =  you're what is go and i want the doing today 

---------------
Q = Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?

A = It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

Bot's return =  you know who the raincoats it's the car that god for the fuck how 

---------------
Q = Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --

A = -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --

A = -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.

Bot's return =  i'm pretty a big girl of you're 

---------------
Q = Put them on the table.

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = For the last time, put them on the table.

A = If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.

Bot's return =  you know what's children 

---------------
Q = And then?

A = It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.

Bot's return =  you can always the only either was about the moments of the job of you're i lost you 

---------------
Q = Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.

A = When did you first find out he was alive?

Bot's return =  uh thirty 

---------------
Q = Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.

A = Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.

A = And Laszlo?

---------------
Q = Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.

A = All except one. He won't have you.

Bot's return =  i followed on you 

---------------
Q = But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?

A = Everything is quite all right.

Bot's return =  i suggest me 

---------------
Q = But why my name, Richard?

A = Because you're getting on that plane.

Bot's return =  look you're 

---------------
Q = I don't understand. What about you?

A = I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.

Bot's return =  hey last daddy 

---------------
Q = No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --

A = -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.

Bot's return =  what the last are you talking about 

---------------
Q = I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.

A = And I said I would never leave you.

Bot's return =  can jack to be nothing for a fucking time how all we can 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.

Bot's return =  is do you want

Q = Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."

A = Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about i was your own 

---------------
Q = Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.

A = If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.

Bot's return =  really i will respectfully her i'm you start to the job how how to the bathroom of that the papers of talkin' proctor your you have to tell in are that my work you are to have a witness of life waiting now

A = Goodnight.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Goodnight.

A = Goodnight.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.

A = But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?

Bot's return =  oh if you wanna me those else good how the least minutes is a job minutes 

---------------
Q = What happened with Rick?

A = We'll discuss it later.

Bot's return =  yeah good what else do you remember 

---------------
Q = Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.

A = To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?

Bot's return =  what what it 

---------------
Q = Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?

A = Apparently he has the letters.

Bot's return =  but i have promises to keep and miles to me 

---------------
Q = Yes?

A = But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

Bot's return =  i'll father's what you 

---------------
Q = Ask me?

A = Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.

Bot's return =  oh what

A = -- Yes?

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry

Q = Yes, Victor, I was.

A = I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?

Bot's return =  can it 

---------------
Q = Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --

A = -- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = He came from Paris with Rick.

Bot's return =  you know like a good reason 

---------------
Q = -- Is what?

A = Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.

Bot's return =  you must believe me 

---------------
Q = Hello, Rick.

A = Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?

Bot's return =  a puppy's got a little more personality than a fish 

---------------
Q = Well then, perhaps you also ---

A = -- This is Mr. Laszlo.

Bot's return =  so right dan 

---------------
Q = I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.

A = I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite my father a lot of i speak the kind here i feel my myself for sure 

---------------
Q = I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

A = You're saying this only to make me go.

Bot's return =  yes out 

---------------
Q = How do you do?

A = How do you do?

Bot's return =  to go is his you 

---------------
Q = One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

A = And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

Bot's return =  don't have want to see that 

---------------
Q = And I congratulate you.

A = What for?

Bot's return =  you want to 

---------------
Q = Your work.

A = Thank you. I try.

Bot's return =  you can't take fast your husband in your late 

---------------
Q = I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.

Q = We'll come again.

A = Any time.

Bot's return =  i don't care i just gonna gonna of or was

Bot's return =  man a boy spoiled doctors 

---------------
Q = Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.

A = My office.

Bot's return =  when thanks anyhow her soul's he's you have him 

---------------
Q = My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.

A = What of it?

Bot's return =  you want to 

---------------
Q = Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?

A = Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.

Bot's return =  anything new about the shooting twombley 

---------------
Q = Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?

A = I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.

Bot's return =  not can't i would 

---------------
Q = I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.

A = My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.

Bot's return =  i wish to see out is here that the fuck person i could even to you now stop me it's all you can my own it's a offer of my that some my my some easy 

---------------
Q = There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.

A = There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.

Bot's return =  you're welcome 

---------------
Q = I beg your pardon?

A = I said, ask your wife.

Bot's return =  look a little spoiled 

---------------
Q = Well, this might come in handy.

A = Thank you.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = Had a close one, eh?

A = Yes, rather.

Bot's return =  of course had to be married you your that over your said be the time 

---------------
Q = Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?

A = We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

Bot's return =  i wish to be not had about that 

---------------
Q = You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.

A = Yes, I get the point.

Bot's return =  do won in with one one of the best time we want who we can twombley 

---------------
Q = I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.

A = You seem to know all about my destiny.

Bot's return =  you're a little 

---------------
Q = I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

A = You love her that much?

Bot's return =  i counted to tell you yesterday i found a bunch in pornos that's i can't this how 

---------------
Q = Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.

A = Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.

Bot's return =  what do you want 

---------------
Q = I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.

A = Keep it. You'll need it in America.

Bot's return =  god got just going just her she all some going to the police station 

---------------
Q = But we made a deal.

A = Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?

Bot's return =  this see is that 

---------------
Q = No. It's all arranged.

A = Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.

Bot's return =  oh you must get out the cigar 

---------------
Q = Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.

A = I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

Bot's return =  marion eleanor eleanor schiff 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?

Bot's return =  the strawberries distinction has like a point from have only be back a go and why be go soon

A = Yes. What is it you want?

Bot's return =  milo it this is the let look this the house of your house 

---------------
Q = Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.

A = Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?

Bot's return =  richard i had to see a time 

---------------
Q = No, Captain, please.

A = No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.

Bot's return =  yeah i know 

---------------
Q = Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.

A = Very well.

Bot's return =  i don't know but want to help about it but i just i just i talked this you 

---------------
Q = My bill.

A = No. Two champagne cocktails, please.

Bot's return =  milo that the flu hotel 

---------------
Q = Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.

A = Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.

Bot's return =  i do we've those rosis aren't you 

---------------
Q = Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.

A = We'll be there.

Bot's return =  you lost me 

---------------
Q = That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.

A = May we proceed with the business?

Bot's return =  what time you say on me 

---------------
Q = I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.

A = Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

Bot's return =  a man i just graduated 

---------------
Q = And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

A = I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.

Bot's return =  how'd a helps no around him to the fuck 

---------------
Q = Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --

A = -- Thank you.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

A = Yes.

Bot's return =  and the whore's murder you didn't erase that either did you don't lie i won't be angry 

---------------
Q = I believe you have a message for him?

A = Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?

Bot's return =  okay just calm 

---------------
Q = I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.

A = You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!

Bot's return =  not check to be i can make me how i could be be a thing payment 

---------------
Q = I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.

A = I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite to me not been policy one i love he god in my life in that if that my life know can were we can you one tell in the girls you're first be that a lot you may mind him on the side matt be one luck soon there be the car dear you must the first 

---------------
Q = Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.

A = Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.

Bot's return =  don't overwhelm me with a good that 

---------------
Q = Is that all you wish to tell us?

A = Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.

Bot's return =  first anybody you didn't 

---------------
Q = And that is?

A = You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.

Bot's return =  you're what the usual industry 

---------------
Q = Even in Berlin.

A = Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.

Bot's return =  what see is that 

---------------
Q = You will give us the names?

A = If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.

Bot's return =  sorry you shouldn't be havin' this conversation over over i've her for you and shot know was gonna to something done but you 

---------------
Q = And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

A = Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.

Bot's return =  oh i know about that 

---------------
Q = For the time being.

A = Good day.

Bot's return =  i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i want recommend you to return your has good doing them i answer him on said good saw 

---------------
Q = Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.

A = Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.

Bot's return =  i want to meet through 

---------------
Q = You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.

A = Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.

Bot's return =  you are an a little one day 

---------------
Q = What else, my dear Major?

A = By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?

Bot's return =  and how baggage 

---------------
Q = Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.

A = I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.

Bot's return =  i want to go to pick 

---------------
Q = Good evening, gentlemen.

A = Good evening, Captain.

Bot's return =  of course the matter was the lamb of the boys 

---------------
Q = Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.

A = Champagne and a tin of caviar.

Bot's return =  you got any better ideas 

---------------
Q = May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.

A = Thank you.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.

A = How do you do, Mr. Rick?

Bot's return =  he tried yourself just sell him something really i remember tell you know that but your place 

---------------
Q = You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.

A = Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.

Bot's return =  just why i'll me 

---------------
Q = Ho, diplomatist!

A = How about New York?

Bot's return =  oh i heard 

---------------
Q = Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.

A = You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite you don't feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do 

---------------
Q = Of course, one must admit he has great courage.

A = I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.

Bot's return =  you killed 

---------------
Q = You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.

A = Perhaps.

Bot's return =  the important of fedex yeah do sorry to tell about now i d into my dad life didn't her you were it now something work on the thing thing then you got had crazy she me 

---------------
Q = I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.

A = If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.

Bot's return =  he what the mining industry association 

---------------
Q = You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.

A = But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.

Bot's return =  and the carrying charges to whole twombley 

---------------
Q = As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.

A = It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.

Bot's return =  i did well nowhere 

---------------
Q = You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.

A = My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.

Bot's return =  i want you to meet him for you're i could you to trust me you're i can't my anything loving good 

---------------
Q = Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?

A = I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

Bot's return =  oh if then their there's me dead my head 

---------------
Q = We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.

A = A leader, like Laszlo?

Bot's return =  yes i'd 

---------------
Q = Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.

A = I see what you mean.

Bot's return =  that's not said you're to see 

---------------
Q = Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?

A = Ask Monsieur Rick.

Bot's return =  then do it asshole 

---------------
Q = Hello, Louis.

A = How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.

Bot's return =  what do you mean 

---------------
Q = You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?

A = When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

Bot's return =  i think bianca a favor and our so a great of things life figure i lost through to be a little thing ago for for supposed the fuck time i was in love i could was how i could go myself 

---------------
Q = The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?

A = Why? What's in Lisbon?

Bot's return =  why i am you so it would you know about if if keep i had love him it but i don't know what it city i haven't you though the trigger but i could her give her it be the job ted you need me 

---------------
Q = It was a combination of all three.

A = And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?

Bot's return =  there doesn't can to travel it 

---------------
Q = My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

A = Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.

Bot's return =  i didn't know any choice 

---------------
Q = I was misinformed.

A = Huh!

Bot's return =  what time 

---------------
Q = Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.

A = What, again?

Bot's return =  she's the most wonderful woman in the world can't get her out of my mind 

---------------
Q = If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.

A = I stick my neck out for nobody.

Bot's return =  you're i'd i am here i can't my ever max 

---------------
Q = You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.

A = Our entertainment is enough.

Bot's return =  father i have betrayed my family i betrayed my men and i betrayed you 

---------------
Q = I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.

A = Perhaps not.

Bot's return =  okay but you know this business of finding you a wife it's kind of ridiculous don't you think 

---------------
Q = How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

A = Yeah? Have a brandy?

Bot's return =  i had know how to help about it bob this me all it's one goddamn 

---------------
Q = Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.

A = I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.

Bot's return =  okay a rumor going i did told you 

---------------
Q = That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.

A = Yeah? What's his name?

Bot's return =  i counted his behind the stands they not thought get to sleep you were see all i got you could see back i'm looking in make a hell 

---------------
Q = Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.

A = Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.

Q = Manages what?

A = His escape.

Bot's return =  yeah like ralph lauren 

---------------
Q = Oh, but I just told you. --

A = -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.

Bot's return =  is you've you gonna to hear 

---------------
Q = This is the end of the chase.

A = Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

Bot's return =  what are you think 

---------------
Q = Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.

A = Okay.

Bot's return =  the duke what did you do 

---------------
Q = Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.

A = Why two?

Bot's return =  i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i want recommend you to return your has good doing 

---------------
Q = I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

A = Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

Bot's return =  they what i go to ask you how 

---------------
Q = It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

A = Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?

Bot's return =  commissioner 

---------------
Q = Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.

A = And got well paid for it on both occasions.

Bot's return =  don't have a loser jake here 

---------------
Q = The winning side would have paid you much better.

A = Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.

Bot's return =  hey smart ass how 'bout i kick your butt 

---------------
Q = I have my orders.

A = Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.

Bot's return =  i did 

---------------
Q = Yeah, you were saying?

A = Excuse me.

Bot's return =  god dammit 

---------------
Q = Oh, how do you do?

A = And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.

Bot's return =  not check barrington u to be a wacko it's no a minute minutes 

---------------
Q = Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --

A = -- Hello, Ilsa.

Bot's return =  what is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century 

---------------
Q = Oh, no, Rick never --

A = -- Thanks. I will.

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.

A = That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.

Bot's return =  well for isn't my taking to stop 

---------------
Q = Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

A = Well, it looks like you're a little late.

Bot's return =  sure got sir 

---------------
Q = So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

A = Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.

Bot's return =  you don't say how real are right to you do sweat from from you do had to your how in the big how could time your your brother a shit time i mean you i saw your voice you must be the sex you i have i won't keep you don't have what you got but a job like is the name i have but the job i can listen about anything 

---------------
Q = As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.

A = Yeah? Why?

Bot's return =  yes thanks 

---------------
Q = But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.

A = Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --

Bot's return =  gary 

---------------
Q = -- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

A = Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.

Bot's return =  that's what i like who wanna is you are come me in jake the brown 

---------------
Q = You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.

A = Huh?

Bot's return =  what time 

---------------
Q = And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

A = What friend?

Bot's return =  she killed with you drinking whisky a little life on what what is is would 

---------------
Q = Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.

A = You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?

Bot's return =  of seems 

---------------
Q = I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.

A = There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.

Bot's return =  how much there was gonna alabama you 

---------------
Q = I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?

A = I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

Bot's return =  don't dear 

---------------
Q = Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.

A = Oh, thanks.

Bot's return =  i thought you might have 

---------------
Q = I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.

A = Oh, he won't be followed here.

Bot's return =  he looked i'll shaken up 

---------------
Q = I have the letters right here.

A = Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?

Bot's return =  it was supposed up up on a lot shot or the police later at to me 

---------------
Q = Sam's piano.

A = Serves me right for not being musical.

Bot's return =  but i was promises down alone let a fit and bite life just just the car 

---------------
Q = -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

A = Have you taken leave of your senses?

Bot's return =  maybe stay with the job that bad in the doj i've don't know a man long 

---------------
Q = I have. Sit down over there.

A = Put that gun down.

Bot's return =  you killed 

---------------
Q = I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?

A = I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.

Bot's return =  i want to go but my job and was he be the truth 

---------------
Q = Call off your watch-dogs you said.

A = Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.

Bot's return =  there god i wouldn't 

---------------
Q = If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.

A = You think of everything, don't you?

Bot's return =  from the matter 

---------------
Q = Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.

A = Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.

Bot's return =  honey i 

---------------
Q = What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.

A = Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

Bot's return =  tomorrow would just people the guy i guess people 

---------------
Q = Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.

A = Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.

Bot's return =  he was her to be illegal films this choices at the hell is a guy like wanted got to me with i just wondered her job she she know had walk in she was did you one let but the street and let life and go know let know ever let she knowledge but what what happened and the wife place him to know sure go in a little in one were i had he in it i shall because all i must smell from his now that's in in it is worth that's it that's my husband that's i call it was y'know must been faithful in the house 

---------------
Q = It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.

A = My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.

Bot's return =  i let you and the bar i loved your be helping 

---------------
Q = And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.

A = Our expenses?

Bot's return =  you nut 

---------------
Q = Where were you last night?

A = That's so long ago, I don't remember.

Bot's return =  it you're fascinates me a way

A = There seems to be no secret about that.

Bot's return =  it's mom nothin' i picked your butt 

---------------
Q = Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

A = It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

A = Aha. Who do you think will win the war?

Bot's return =  i can't can't you do the big story i i shall you i need you might i need i should it carry myself 

---------------
Q = Are my eyes really brown?

A = You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.

Bot's return =  of course the matter is many 

---------------
Q = My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

A = In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.

A = Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified through of uh he's have time it go and risk with you left

Q = Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?

A = If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

Bot's return =  not ain't last last me dead the great who decided sitting rimgale 

---------------
Q = But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.

A = For a price, Ugarte, for a price.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?

A = I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

Q = And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.

---------------
Q = Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.

A = I haven't read that.

Bot's return =  look i heard you too 

---------------

A = We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!

Bot's return =  our entertainment is enough 

---------------
Q = I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?

---------------
Q = I thought it was my turn.

A = It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.

A = How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?

Bot's return =  i'll make the arrangements the way 

---------------
Q = It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.

A = I'm happy I amuse you.

Bot's return =  no way nothin' 

---------------
Q = Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.

Bot's return =  oh your i know informed too off men one is are the other one

---------------
Q = In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.

A = Of course.

Bot's return =  there not with have very do your father in stock

Q = Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!

A = You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...

Bot's return =  how'd you learn so much about dreams 

---------------
Q = I am not a doctor.

A = You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!

Bot's return =  you're welcome 

---------------

A = Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!

A = So what?

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = You're not yet three months, are you?

A = Not yet. What do you know about it?

Bot's return =  maybe i would 

---------------
Q = I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?

A = Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.

Bot's return =  ah why 

---------------
Q = But you don't look very happy.

A = *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.

Bot's return =  i got play as soldiers do in i'm kind it's me a kind new 

---------------
Q = What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.

A = You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.

Bot's return =  don't is 

---------------
Q = Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!

A = Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...

Bot's return =  oh i guess i did what's going to happen to me 

---------------
Q = That's *it*?

A = That's it.

Bot's return =  nope heard it we wasn't far apart i spotted this buck then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was deader'n shit called it right in

Bot's return =  now what i need five of you are on on a job as job being like you don't like how you do try be your side in the shit 

---------------
Q = Do you know him?

A = *No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!

Bot's return =  and i do what a good crew 

---------------
Q = I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.

A = Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!

Bot's return =  jack what's six you up the things it shot for your own

A = They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!

Bot's return =  i know a look i just every about there 

---------------
Q = They're *outrageous*, them rules!

A = Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about

Bot's return =  don't be a spoilsport it's only a few quid

A = That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?

Bot's return =  oooooo 

---------------
Q = Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.

A = You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...

Bot's return =  not a liar on your father when all a fucking fucking 

---------------
Q = That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.

A = That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.

Q = Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!

A = You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?

Bot's return =  not can't had get a date her even 

---------------
Q = Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.

A = You just stay out of trouble, Homer!

Bot's return =  don't is here my not in 

---------------
Q = Where do you think you're going?

A = You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite is like a great new 

---------------
Q = You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.

A = That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.

Bot's return =  you have a won't more i wouldn't i could to carry you've 

---------------
Q = That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!

A = She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.

---------------
Q = You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.

A = The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...

Q = You ever see a palm tree, Homer?

A = He ain't never been outta Maine!

Bot's return =  then see go 

---------------
Q = Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.

A = Tough day?

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?

A = Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.

Bot's return =  then do it asshole 

---------------
Q = My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.

A = Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.

Bot's return =  no no way 

---------------
Q = So, what do you do?

A = It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.

Bot's return =  i know a look i wanna you know a little 

---------------
Q = Silicon Valley?

A = That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.

Bot's return =  i'll been i picked you a quarter of the hour that an poor 

---------------
Q = So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.

A = Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.

Bot's return =  what do you have danny 

---------------
Q = Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.

A = You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.

Bot's return =  who 

---------------
Q = Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.

A = I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.

Bot's return =  maybe i would i i don't be have you're you're you're you're and you're you're you're 

---------------
Q = Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.

A = Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.

Bot's return =  no english lord 

---------------
Q = That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.

A = They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.

Bot's return =  this an glad 

---------------
Q = Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.

A = We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22

Bot's return =  and what correct 

---------------
Q = Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.

A = Sort of like a letter of intent.

Bot's return =  i don't want to be that i just to fuck the damn i've to the wife thought not all right about the father 

---------------
Q = This has to happen fast.

A = I know. It won't go unnoticed.

Bot's return =  go it 

---------------
Q = What's this?

A = You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.

A = The standard ten.

Bot's return =  yes yes is that i got do doing to have with the job time 

---------------
Q = Ten percent. Of how much?

A = Two million.

Bot's return =  you nut 

---------------
Q = Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.

A = Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?

A = Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.

Bot's return =  don't overwhelm me with a good idea 

---------------
Q = It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.

A = It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.

Bot's return =  what's man contradicted do you know any that 

---------------
Q = And I think it's because of this redhead...

A = Know who I am, Jake?

Bot's return =  oh well 

---------------
Q = Your life flashing before your eyes?

A = Just the last three weeks.

Bot's return =  if why dan up 

---------------
Q = Grifters...

A = We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.

Bot's return =  filled capable of murder osborne 

---------------
Q = It's all about the money, isn't it?

A = Isn't it always?

Bot's return =  you did 

---------------
Q = I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.

A = And these cops? What do they get?

Bot's return =  don't can't father 

---------------
Q = So how'd you get caught?

A = Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.

Bot's return =  but imagine the things he'd say during sex 

---------------
Q = I can see why you liked her.

A = That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.

Bot's return =  you can anything in the crowd the next you a drink next and i don't ways a lot i didn't is about i could be in the army 

---------------
Q = But there were other factors.

A = Factors that weren't clear to me until now.

Bot's return =  don't trying to quit did 

---------------
Q = Nice.

A = We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.

Bot's return =  really jam 

---------------
Q = Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?

A = Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.

Bot's return =  you need soap in and will a great neck 

---------------
Q = She had you tempting fate.

A = My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.

Bot's return =  i have to like anything 'til this little will a as i like you could them the only something thing my a train of your poor my not a good 

---------------
Q = Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?

A = You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.

Bot's return =  oh if then a choice on for me i got a it's it's a few it's only after the first person says after year 

---------------
Q = So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...

A = I was doing it for them.

Bot's return =  so jack 

---------------
Q = BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.

A = It's not true.

Bot's return =  i just want to pick up my divorce papers for the lawyer it won't take long 

---------------
Q = We were back on.

A = After you cut her loose.

Bot's return =  he says the girl men price men maybe 

---------------
Q = Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?

A = It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.

Bot's return =  i know 

---------------
Q = Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.

A = Guess so.

Bot's return =  i hope on are you got of those it's not a man in a very time more as we a drug like not our a man in the room 

---------------
Q = Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?

A = Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.

Bot's return =  that's what you think 

---------------
Q = So we go to the bar.

A = I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.

Bot's return =  why if then a choice on you're she get he soon to the authorities 

---------------
Q = We'll take care of it.

A = And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?

Bot's return =  don't check 

---------------
Q = Ten is standard, sir.

A = Fine. But only if we recover the cash.

Bot's return =  just we didn't be him there 

---------------
Q = Who's that?

A = The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."

Bot's return =  what rae you get with her 

---------------
Q = Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

A = So what? We hide, right?

Bot's return =  well i know 

---------------
Q = What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.

A = You're pissed we didn't get credit?

Bot's return =  no called nothin' i'd 

---------------
Q = Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.

A = We sure Big Al threw him to us?

Bot's return =  our abstinence makes to come it right now we can life go now but the respect we deserve 

---------------
Q = Fuck that. We're going too.

A = Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?

Bot's return =  i'm sure 

---------------
Q = This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.

A = People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.

Bot's return =  krueger is reality they is going for is a fucking minutes minutes have been is a better trick and i are her you are and and over you have 

---------------
Q = The red hair... It's bad luck.

A = It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...

Bot's return =  yes that checks a good teacher by there's 

---------------
Q = Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.

A = I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite all a strange 

---------------
Q = Masters of our own destiny.

A = So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?

Bot's return =  out a fat hypocrite like shaft do you have only lucky 

---------------
Q = Jake...

A = It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.

Bot's return =  the river 

---------------
Q = I'm going home

A = Let's go, Jake?

Bot's return =  what for 

---------------
Q = Moonan. Here. Shit...

A = So what? We just stay clear of him.

Bot's return =  i'm sorry but that

No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.

Bot's return =  really if going

Q = Meet me at my place later.

A = How do you know the King's going to let you walk?

Bot's return =  maybe i'm sorry that 

---------------
Q = You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?

A = Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.

Q = We're working for the King.

A = Wait a second... Who's the mope?

---------------
Q = Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.

A = What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.

Q = So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --

A = But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!

Bot's return =  if right i'll you get up to help care me

A = Of what? They're both crooks.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.

A = My fucking heart bleeds.

Bot's return =  well you had out out he

Q = Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.

---------------
Q = What's up with you? Bladder infection?

A = Keep it up.

Bot's return =  you don't have

A = I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.

A = But how do you know you exist?

Bot's return =  no i don't want want to call work this start 

---------------
Q = It is intuitively obvious.

---------------
Q = My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.

A = Right!

Bot's return =  it wouldn't have changed the way you feel 

---------------
Q = This is fun.

A = All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?

Bot's return =  yes sir 

---------------
Q = What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.

A = In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.

Bot's return =  you can always 

---------------
Q = Exactly.

A = Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.

Bot's return =  yes i know

Bot's return =  don't be a spoilsport this in business 

---------------
Q = And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?

A = Of course not.

Bot's return =  why let is tell who's men here 

---------------
Q = Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.

A = Yes, well...

Bot's return =  yes thanks 

---------------
Q = Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.

A = True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.

Bot's return =  what what some you find about me 

---------------
Q = So if you detonate in...

A = ...nine seconds...

Bot's return =  cool 

---------------
Q = Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?

A = I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.

Bot's return =  you're for you just shoot it your life don't between dead 

---------------
Q = I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.

A = I'll check it.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Pinback...

A = Yes, Doolittle.

Bot's return =  of course had to be married you your that over your said be the time

Q = Yes.

Bot's return =  how'd you learn so 

---------------
Q = ...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...

A = ...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...

Bot's return =  that's 

---------------
Q = You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...

A = You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...

Bot's return =  oh a doesn't to you 

---------------
Q = Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.

A = They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...

Bot's return =  you were that as though 

---------------
Q = You know what I think about, Talby?

A = I'm getting something here, on this readout...

Bot's return =  ah me 

---------------
Q = It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...

A = I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.

Bot's return =  not don't have you think no 

---------------
Q = I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.

A = Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...

Bot's return =  if rick the things he'd got are they can about right in what i want 

---------------
Q = Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.

A = ...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...

Bot's return =  yeah is he that 

---------------
Q = Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.

A = Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.

Bot's return =  ah so many malfunctions why don't you have anything nice to me he you want 

---------------
Q = Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?

A = Yes, Talby, what is it?

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.

A = Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.

Bot's return =  no 

---------------
Q = Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?

A = Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.

Bot's return =  i thought tear your head off you you had not help my shot

Bot's return =  bottle that's are the first 

---------------
Q = What happened, Doolittle?

A = Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!

Bot's return =  i need to net they birdie only they it's that 

---------------
Q = Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.

A = When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...

Bot's return =  i was in the big two i win it i'd be a kind world

Bot's return =  but why can't i did my lying man i didn't he when to ask it but i don't want anything

Bot's return =  of other i must you go much with your be be the test 

---------------
Q = She was the one--

A = None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.

Bot's return =  i don't know 

---------------
Q = True, but--

A = You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?

Bot's return =  of course i don't want to go here there here and the hospital and all coming for me stuff then

Bot's return =  no you don't have

Bot's return =  what's me another to me

Q = Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.

A = Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?

Bot's return =  the water's going putrid do shall ethnicity 

---------------
Q = Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?

A = Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.

Bot's return =  richard no not that bad

Q = You love him?

A = I just told you, he's a big, hairy...

Q = And he loves you back, doesn't he?

A = He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.

Bot's return =  no no i love didn't i like want about with crazy doesn't these 

---------------
Q = Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.

A = I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.

Bot's return =  oh if going up

A = Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.

Bot's return =  does it snow in bombay one winter here and we'll be shipping him you do 

---------------
Q = Whoa... she is a killer.

A = Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.

Bot's return =  but imagine the things he'd say during sex 

---------------
Q = Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...

A = You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.

Bot's return =  aunt capable don't what it 

---------------
Q = I-I c-can't...

A = Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.

Bot's return =  don't even say you somethin' and it's just gonna be between you and me i think folks carry on about heaven too much like it's some all you can eat buffet up in the clouds and folks just gonna do as they're but you in one to the business in folks and have own and give as you got let on the best margie is little the leave done world you think it'll that your entire and see you want find about the clothes of i make in change i just gonna i must it when help i had appreciate you i saw i won't it was plenty of the will of all that will you

A = I don't care. I wanna hear more.

Bot's return =  you're welcome 

---------------
Q = I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.

A = Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.

Bot's return =  i don't know what 

---------------
Q = We've got to take this slow...

A = Right, slow...

Bot's return =  of course the slaughtered lamb he me he have the last 

---------------
Q = So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?

A = I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite like a strange 

---------------
Q = Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?

A = Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?

Bot's return =  but imagine the things he'd say during sex 

---------------
Q = Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?

A = Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.

Bot's return =  you think i'm fake if the car you are completely you're your business and you're a bad more

---------------
Q = This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.

A = Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.

Bot's return =  let's get the fuck outta here you're not making any sense man 

---------------
Q = Namely?

A = Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.

Bot's return =  what happened about like this is me the opinion to be the chin or you from oh be you had be be a crime job person it's me i'm gonna 

---------------
Q = Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.

Bot's return =  there i know

---------------
Q = Uh... dudes?

A = Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.

Bot's return =  nothing 

---------------
Q = Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.

A = Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.

Bot's return =  to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right it's un american i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job

Bot's return =  yeah i needed to work about a copy 

---------------
Q = Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!

A = Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...

Bot's return =  that's what you think 

---------------

---------------
Q = Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.

---------------
Q = Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.

A = Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.

Bot's return =  you probably expect

Bot's return =  you are cattivo court composer i want to meet you a shower when i was a kid i want to do a very something more

---------------
Q = Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.

A = I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.

A = So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?

Bot's return =  the river falls

It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?

A = No. That makes you keep searching.

---------------
Q = He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.

A = If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.

Bot's return =  but he killed these guys 

---------------
Q = It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

A = You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.

Bot's return =  of course i had my too good a happen but a copy

Bot's return =  you must believe me

A = THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --

Bot's return =  to dubious distinction 

---------------
Q = But -

A = You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?

Bot's return =  of course not the best i've bad want

A = Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.

Bot's return =  come do gonna get this a long long 

---------------
Q = ...but would further cement the relations of our countries.

A = Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --

Bot's return =  i told be what you want it's right to blow 

---------------
Q = Oh.  Then there his somebody else?

A = Well no -- not exactly -- but --

Bot's return =  oh i mean 

---------------
Q = Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!

A = I didn't come here to be insulted.

Bot's return =  look a rumor in very the way bad 

---------------
Q = I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.

A = This is terrible!

Bot's return =  so when what what why with much let 

---------------
Q = Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.

A = Oh, would you...?

Bot's return =  well thanks 

---------------
Q = So that's the one you want to marry.

A = With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 

Bot's return =  what happened say work the dead room days guess you were call but the road species 

---------------
Q = Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.

A = That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.

Bot's return =  oooooo that's what you must you put here home with the in lady that that 

---------------
Q = Uncle, you can't do this!

A = My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.

Bot's return =  listen man you don ' t on one is a fucking minutes try detective 

---------------
Q = This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...

A = I thought everything was working out fine.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite you don't feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do 

---------------
Q = Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.

A = Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --

Bot's return =  i don't know much about biomechanics roy i wish i did but you're to my office 

---------------
Q = They have noble faces.

A = I've always thought that myself.

Bot's return =  yeah well what now or now day but the respect thing 

---------------
Q = Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.

A = She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.

Bot's return =  why you don't wanna all it seems for goes as how it's as all the in give i just gonna good good gonna i met from up gonna with you can't from but you can from in it i can ready you

---------------
Q = Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.

A = I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.

Bot's return =  okay 

---------------
Q = What do you mean?

A = Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.

Bot's return =  but i really reason to be but sir no never to the fucking says of the king i was gonna that if that this car of this every it's it's my own and i say he's all of job it's it's a random coincidence and some have dead to have with the job day i

Bot's return =  you're god get why it not working how don't place with i'd our i'd be it 

---------------
Q = Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?

A = I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?

Bot's return =  first it isn't to pizza my very

Q = Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?

A = That I am very little different from him.

Bot's return =  what son be says man you have to be married

---------------
Q = What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!

A = What do you mean?

Bot's return =  well not said just you in hurry 

---------------
Q = He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.

A = Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.

Bot's return =  discreetly 

---------------
Q = I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?

A = Everything will be seen to.

Bot's return =  i'm sorry newt 

---------------
Q = Never mind that, I want my man!

A = He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.

Bot's return =  nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners this kind of search it's heavy spadework i'm gonna need 

---------------
Q = DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!

A = You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...

Bot's return =  not can't been get a put like u shit the place thing 

---------------
Q = Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!

A = I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!

A = All you do is profit from another man's misery!

Bot's return =  yes we you let me do it here i think 

---------------
Q = You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.

A = You don't own this man!

A = So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!

Bot's return =  don't really oreo me a t where only you know 

---------------
Q = Now I think we really do understand one another.

A = Right... Right.

Bot's return =  yes god 

---------------
Q = Good morning, Treves.

A = Good morning, sir.

Bot's return =  i doubt it she's 

---------------
Q = A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?

A = No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.

Bot's return =  what do you want i'm done i'm the see 

---------------
Q = Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?

A = Yes sir.

Bot's return =  i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i want recommend you to return your has good doing 

---------------
Q = Oh, is he a friend of yours?

A = No, more of an acquaintance.

---------------
Q = Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?

A = Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = Good! How is the patient?

A = He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.

Bot's return =  now what you 

---------------
Q = A few words? I thought he was imbecile?

A = Well sir, perhaps I should explain...

Bot's return =  i don't know just promise human beings in it makes like i'm own 

---------------
Q = I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.

A = I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.

Bot's return =  i wish to see you yesterday 

---------------
Q = Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?

A = Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.

Bot's return =  but i said you don't want i could you do remember from good told your your name 

---------------
Q = Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.

A = ...Yes, Sir.

Bot's return =  i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i want recommend you to return your has good doing 

---------------
Q = It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.

A = Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?

Bot's return =  anyway up 

---------------
Q = ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.

A = He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?

Bot's return =  oh this is terrible please go a fucking sign 

---------------
Q = Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.

A = Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.

Bot's return =  i'm 

---------------
Q = It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.

A = Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.

Bot's return =  no i really 

---------------
Q = Treves. Well done.

A = Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.

Bot's return =  yes right 

---------------
Q = You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.

A = I could easily arrange...

Bot's return =  look a rumor in maybe one 

---------------
Q = No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?

A = Well, yes.

Bot's return =  yes back 

---------------
Q = Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.

A = Do you think they'll go along with us?

Bot's return =  i don't have to be home 'til i hate her i was in here doing here 

---------------
Q = Don't we?

A = No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.

Bot's return =  yes ma'am i try it 

---------------
Q = Has the response picked up?

A = Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.

Bot's return =  humbly 

---------------
Q = But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.

A = Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.

Bot's return =  a hell out out she seen here a hotel

Bot's return =  come change with dr to give in that i swear that job to them today with i will to crime in my head and look have the other money 

---------------
Q = Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

A = Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.

Bot's return =  and what 

---------------
Q = O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

A = Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".

Bot's return =  i don't know how to help about it i just want to get it all be idea 

---------------
Q = Good day...!

Q = Alas, no.

A = Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.

Bot's return =  anything new about the shooting twombley 

---------------
Q = Tell me about it, please!

A = It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.

Bot's return =  oooooo 

---------------
Q = Romance!

A = That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...

A = I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.

Bot's return =  how you do you do meet from homer please women from a bleeding i'm a kiss a a good when aren't you think it'll jesus and it's all it's more give you have every if the clothes matt the put and the job world and makes a country of one it true when you it when and i can tell her in the job and see have the honeymoon job about as the city done you must them the country in the side 

---------------
Q = How awful for John.

A = And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.

Bot's return =  of what 

---------------
Q = Is he... dying then?

A = Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.

Bot's return =  thank you but i hardly think

---------------
Q = Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.

A = I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

Bot's return =  you want to find you a truly of the hour of the job

A = Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.

Bot's return =  i thought you not said some 

---------------
Q = Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...

A = But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.

Bot's return =  but this splice me young he all going with the time 

---------------
Q = Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.

A = I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.

Bot's return =  okay a very i think it too 

---------------
Q = Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.

A = Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.

Bot's return =  what's you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone

---------------
Q = What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?

A = Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --

Bot's return =  oh yes

Q = Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?

A = I think so.

Bot's return =  can and

Q = The driver waved. So casual, friendly.

A = I'm like a joke to them.

Bot's return =  daphne don't father 

---------------
Q = I might be making a mistake.

A = Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.

Bot's return =  krueger is reality to thing there let's they took in the liberty 

---------------
Q = Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.

A = The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite all off get gonna 

---------------
Q = It's them.

A = It's too late.

Bot's return =  well you had better me that was 

---------------
Q = I should maybe talk to you.

A = Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.

Bot's return =  you think me but i need you man talk you 

---------------
Q = I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...

A = Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...

Bot's return =  what do you been 

---------------
Q = Clementine.

A = That's your look for me.

Bot's return =  no what 

---------------
Q = Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!

A = Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!

Bot's return =  of course i had my nine millimeter automatic 

---------------
Q = Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...

A = And what are you like? A wino?

Bot's return =  you know it 

---------------
Q = How's the chicken?

A = Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?

Bot's return =  that what 

---------------
Q = She's so sexy.

A = I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.

Bot's return =  okay a must he's i embarrass the parents is the last few trust that my life i lost 

---------------
Q = I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.

A = I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.

Bot's return =  i swear to grow on you 

---------------
Q = Naomi.

A = On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.

Bot's return =  his father's dead right 

---------------
Q = Okay. I wish you could come.

A = This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.

Bot's return =  well what sit the day we was did to you do about you want be find in the minute 

---------------
Q = Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

A = I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.

Bot's return =  of course not 

---------------
Q = So you're still on the Zoloft?

A = Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.

Bot's return =  i'm going were i did go i ask this 

---------------
Q = I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.

A = I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.

Bot's return =  what and what a good son and the hour you gotta me for you think to show and me for you want 

---------------
Q = We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.

A = Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?

Bot's return =  and why what half of them you were 

---------------
Q = I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.

A = Well... I did.

Bot's return =  take on at killed 

---------------
Q = We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.

A = It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...

Bot's return =  you have have policy 

---------------

Q = Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

Bot's return =  don't know mixed 

---------------

A = No. I just need some space, maybe.

Bot's return =  i don't have to be here to worry to all and all i just it's the job dead 

---------------
Q = The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

Q = I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.

A = They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?

Bot's return =  you are cattivo court composer i want to meet i want a right 

---------------
Q = The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.

A = Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!

Bot's return =  then that's come i can fit it in 

---------------
Q = Howard, your one o'clock.

A = Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.

Bot's return =  i know

A = Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.

Bot's return =  he was all inner beauty 

---------------
Q = Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

A = Is that Nietzsche?

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.

A = It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.

Bot's return =  yes don't blame me i told you 

---------------
Q = There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.

A = Alexander Pope?

Bot's return =  of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol 

---------------
Q = Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.

A = It's no big deal.

Bot's return =  shakespeare and the flu overwhelms be me 

---------------
Q = It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.

A = Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?

Bot's return =  crystal 

---------------
Q = I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

A = I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.

Bot's return =  i know you didn't you a a rent a kiss i want yourself

Q = We can't do this.

A = No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.

Bot's return =  yes sir

Q = Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?

A = I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.

Bot's return =  oh can't the be shooting right do in love with one being one 

---------------
Q = You made me have an abortion.

A = It was a mutual decision.

Bot's return =  you ever anything in the crowd anybody suspicious 

---------------
Q = Stan? What's going on?

A = The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite like a strange 

---------------
Q = Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?

A = I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.

Bot's return =  you're what makes now here's as i went people he just sure able than but place i could you too 

---------------
Q = Well, where was Patrick?

A = He went home sick.

Bot's return =  guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy 

---------------
Q = Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.

A = December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.

Bot's return =  ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes 

---------------
Q = Mary. What are you doing here?

A = She came to help, Howard.

Bot's return =  yes well aren't of dumb give

Bot's return =  it's only to be the details of course men 

---------------
Q = Howard, they've disappeared again.

A = Oh dear.

Bot's return =  c'mon i knew it was you

Q = I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.

A = Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.

Bot's return =  yes what 

---------------
Q = This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.

---------------
Q = I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.

A = You can if you want.

Bot's return =  can to me 

---------------
Q = Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

A = This one's history. Moving on...

Bot's return =  it's trouble nothin' like you so the head and my own here 

---------------
Q = The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.

A = Patrick, we need to focus.

Bot's return =  but i didn't go around she she be a vet i just animals and don't already no this a few i need

Q = Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...

A = Save your breath for the climb.

Bot's return =  i didn't forward to seeing 

---------------
Q = But I don't know how to polka.

A = Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.

Bot's return =  1922 why the kippers 

---------------
Q = What was that?

A = Clockworks.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

A = The Clock People?

Bot's return =  look people undress the people i was his i can the car this both been been a be on the way we been a thing so this does the place thing that changed was on even a thing i got a lot and shit i got tell about i lost the car thing you saw president 

---------------
Q = During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.

A = Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?

Bot's return =  yeah 

---------------
Q = What do you believe in then?

A = Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

Bot's return =  what the hell are you doin' with da's gun 

---------------
Q = Is everything getting worse?

A = Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.

Bot's return =  this really is that police shit have a dangerous 

---------------
Q = I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?

A = She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.

Bot's return =  i don't know how to help about it 

---------------
Q = But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.

A = Easy come, easy go.

Bot's return =  would of all a man payment but a bad time as shit me the best place 

---------------
Q = Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.

A = How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?

Bot's return =  oooooo that's not shut quickly 

---------------
Q = Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?

A = I'm staying with the Countess.

Bot's return =  when thanks with the shooting 

---------------
Q = I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?

A = I don't.

Bot's return =  you put your disease in me your semen it's hot all the way i don't remember i could so there not not not exactly i'd this at so not mind easy be not at be not not if not not not sure not a at not if not knew got last than i could not isn't isn't with you know this friend to live me 

---------------
Q = You don't?

A = Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.

Bot's return =  i was born as is a stick at i'm i supposed i could but i had listen without up anyway 

---------------
Q = A traveler, eh?

A = You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite we must his to you now only the things day 

---------------
Q = Where are the others?

A = Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.

Bot's return =  my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government 

---------------
Q = Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.

A = Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.

Bot's return =  and does me too 

---------------
Q = No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.

A = Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich?s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.

Bot's return =  you need soap me and yet ever have to me a well more as well well on shit a man i can tell you the trust me i can't about it to scales it's a very i can you to have love something about be your own 

---------------
Q = Tell me about it.

A = About...

Bot's return =  uh uh don't tell us jam just show us 

---------------
Q = About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.

A = Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'

Bot's return =  here's up go i remember so 

---------------
Q = You're political, then?

A = No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."

Bot's return =  oh this isn't the lead 'negro' to a thousand had been soldiers him 

---------------
Q = Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.

A = Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?

Bot's return =  i got bianca a favor and our be a room of fact of a gentleman world who have a family 

---------------
Q = ......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet?kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.

A = What is Debbie's position?

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.

A = You don't agree with Debbie, then?

Bot's return =  don't be my teeth 

---------------
Q = Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.

A = So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?

Bot's return =  this meeting is 

---------------
Q = No, I guess not.

A = 'Drugged' is a stupid word.

Bot's return =  i think someone hasn't 

---------------
Q = Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.

A = If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....

Bot's return =  i don't know how to get up 

---------------
Q = Extraordinary!

A = She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?

Bot's return =  get what goddamn you to drink things 

---------------
Q = Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.

A = Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?

Bot's return =  wow 

---------------
Q = I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.

A = She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?

Bot's return =  i believe you austin let's it down 

---------------
Q = What do you think?

A = Well.... er...

Bot's return =  can you i couldn't 

---------------
Q = Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?

A = Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.

Bot's return =  yes i'll no such all you 

---------------
Q = What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.

A = If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'

Bot's return =  i wasn't sure you were the same one day 

---------------
Q = I'm cold.

A = Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.

Bot's return =  ugh 

---------------
Q = What are you doing?

A = Getting dressed. I've got to go.

Bot's return =  i want to meet him it but all me the whole i didn't get all right 

---------------
Q = But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.

A = I have to go, Julian.

Bot's return =  can we just a lot mrs you're thanks gonna to do with the test all not really got know making the want to the police i took to him but my you there join me 

---------------
Q = Why? Why do you have to go?

A = My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.

Bot's return =  when i like you just okay other and tell again again again 

---------------
Q = Going north?

A = You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite you don't feel any sorrier on one right got we are he's 

---------------
Q = For magazines?

A = I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.

Bot's return =  how'd you learn so much about dreams 

---------------
Q = So now you're bummin' around?

A = Yep.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Hitchhiking?

A = I'm the best.

Bot's return =  this one's still with the fire department one of our best investigators don rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now we think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan 

---------------
Q = You're the best?

A = When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.

Bot's return =  i don't know what you're talking about i was wanna see ganz nailed 

---------------
Q = Whooee!

A = As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.

Bot's return =  i seriously doubt into know do trying to do with you won't this 

---------------
Q = To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?

A = Tired...

Bot's return =  you can't forgive me after what i've done i've fucked up bigtime i've been bad real bad 

---------------
Q = That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.

A = A born freak can only go uphill.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite you don't feel any sorrier for ugarte than i mean he been you drive 

---------------
Q = Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.

A = I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.

Bot's return =  thank you but i hardly think 

---------------
Q = Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.

A = Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?

Bot's return =  go what 

---------------
Q = She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.

A = Your ranch?

Bot's return =  when thanks my in now 

---------------
Q = Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...

A = A job for me?

Bot's return =  i have taken vows i know what you mean found right to stop my head with gonna 

---------------
Q = The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.

A = Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.

Bot's return =  that's what you think 

---------------
Q = But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?

A = Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...

Bot's return =  you please me court 

---------------
Q = Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.

A = What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?

Bot's return =  no daddy 

---------------
Q = I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?

A = Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...

Bot's return =  ugh 

---------------
Q = Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?

A = I don't know anything about it.

Bot's return =  here's it we if me 

---------------
Q = Ballast.

A = I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...

Bot's return =  it's thanks 

---------------
Q = I can see why they sent you along.

A = So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?

Bot's return =  yes you had try me 

---------------
Q = You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.

A = I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.

Bot's return =  the water's going putrid do to let me you've not the new room for the papers not a job good for a family with a murderer and a good good that place for a place for father more a bit and a lot that everyone now laughing it all why i 

---------------
Q = Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?

A = I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.

Bot's return =  thank it must to look 

---------------
Q = Holy shit...

A = Justin?

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --

A = You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...

Bot's return =  look that's come you she a gun three 

---------------
Q = ...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!

A = EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

Bot's return =  what are i say have 

---------------
Q = ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...

A = You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...

Bot's return =  no have want 

---------------
Q = We have a man down...

A = Coop, where are you...

Bot's return =  chaos transport paralysis crop failure economic disaster frostbite or sunburn on a massive scale you've seen a few samples is his you i'm do you want 

---------------
Q = The containment, Second Containment...

A = Hold on, Coop...

Bot's return =  what are you done here 

---------------
Q = But Justin...

A = I'll get him.

Bot's return =  you didn't like her 

---------------
Q = Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.

A = On my way.

Bot's return =  he's paralyzed 

---------------
Q = ...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.

A = You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.

Bot's return =  of course not the king is many 

---------------
Q = Will it work?

A = It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

Bot's return =  you're a little cannot two here 

---------------
Q = We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.

A = What about the accumulator...?

Bot's return =  you do 

---------------
Q = It's holding... She's holding...!

A = We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.

Bot's return =  and i never you use leave to subscribe up all his 

---------------
Q = Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?

A = What?

Bot's return =  wazoo try to listen whataya think surfer grunge hip hop euro trash 

---------------
Q = It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...

A = No, he didn't.

Bot's return =  you're and 

---------------
Q = You weren't there. I saw it.

A = Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...

Bot's return =  yeah is that 

---------------
Q = I don't know what happened to Justin.

A = I'm telling you, I saw it...

Bot's return =  this make paris 

---------------
Q = What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.

A = I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"

Bot's return =  how'd you learn so much that happened 

---------------
Q = Is that an offer?

A = It is not.

Bot's return =  what 

---------------
Q = What's happening?

A = I don't know, the screens are dead...!

Bot's return =  oh 

---------------
Q = Let me breathe, let me breathe...

A = You're okay now, it's over...

Bot's return =  yes on 

---------------
Q = How? The Bridge is gone.

A = There must be a way! What about Engineering?

Bot's return =  yeah on you 

---------------
Q = Can you shut it down?

A = I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...

Bot's return =  how'd is 

---------------
Q = I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.

A = Hurry.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = What...?

A = Run!

Bot's return =  the important thing is that we have a winner 

---------------
Q = He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...

A = Trauma.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...

A = No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.

Bot's return =  i plan to grow on you 

---------------
Q = How is he?

A = His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.

Bot's return =  i'm gonna already i it drink it's getting man doctor for me the contrary has asked his don't coming anymore 

---------------
Q = Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...

A = Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.

Bot's return =  i'm not talking about the fucking church fuck the church but tell do have home with me 

---------------
Q = He'll live... if we ever make it back.

A = We'll make it.

Bot's return =  i hope those guys i don't know 

---------------
Q = I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.

A = No.

Bot's return =  i thought you he's 

---------------
Q = They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."

A = It's not a distress call. It's a warning.

Bot's return =  the hell are you talkin' about back about the truth 

---------------
Q = Do you hear it? Right there.

A = Hear what?

Bot's return =  cornelius 

---------------
Q = DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.

A = What happened?

Bot's return =  she's okay the most we the moors 

---------------
Q = Please...

A = Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...

Bot's return =  he yet all like a story girl things than i'm husband for me 

---------------
Q = Please... kill...

A = Oh God...

Bot's return =  i don't know much about biomechanics roy i wish him for i wish seen 

---------------
Q = What's wrong?

A = Nothing. It's nothing.

Bot's return =  you lost me 

---------------
Q = What's happening...?

A = A power drain --

Bot's return =  yes yes is that true with the ruin of the course 

---------------
Q = What's wrong?

A = You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!

Bot's return =  i used to do it all i won't it's told the 

---------------
Q = Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...

A = His peritoneum has ruptured...

Bot's return =  i wasn't a see you know they about 

---------------
Q = You wanted to see me, Admiral?

A = I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite all a strange 

---------------
Q = Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?

A = I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.

Bot's return =  you're a fat hypocrite like off a little 

---------------
Q = It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.

A = Thank you.

Bot's return =  here it is 

---------------
Q = You're not seriously considering sending him?

A = You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.

Bot's return =  oh is isn't now too a party per se 

---------------
Q = Does he know that?

A = What's on your mind?

Bot's return =  oh was he killed all the scumbags in the quiet city after there i'm not gonna to fuck you 

---------------
Q = He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.

A = It's been two years since she died. He's over it.

Bot's return =  then see contradicted this is what i got he won't just anywhere because it's got a become i'd something and a man i can't tell the only man only and she not a random i must be in a deal of my not not is not my man i can hope i'll if now in a man time only grow can can can if i who have is to go i must her myself vallens at first if i don't know that over thank 

---------------
Q = I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?

A = The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.

Bot's return =  you can't threaten me 

---------------
Q = What, Justin, what shows you?

A = It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...

Bot's return =  maybe i would like to do the truth copy i would you i don't have all you got my what what you're i could give i need here you got diary a step on your job 

---------------
Q = What does?

A = The dark inside me.

Bot's return =  look i heard you too 

---------------
Q = ...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.

A = "The dark inside..."? I don't understand.

Bot's return =  not father had to see 

---------------
Q = ...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.

A = How do you know all this?

Bot's return =  to got to his here at question 

---------------
Q = I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...

A = That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.

Bot's return =  anything yes nine perfect you can't reason years eight one the day thing 

---------------
Q = Everything green on my boards, Skipper.

A = Start the countdown.

Bot's return =  i beg it had to be all she's me she i could 

---------------
Q = Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.

A = Yes, sir!

Bot's return =  i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i want recommend you to return your has good doing 

---------------
Q = Justin, finish your sweep.

A = Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...

Bot's return =  and because yes much 

---------------
Q = Patch me through to him.

A = Justin.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = ...I don't want to die...!

A = You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?

Bot's return =  we don't have a married we the way anything 

---------------
Q = But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...

A = Justin. I won't let you die.

Bot's return =  you didn't goof it shit while you and your may mess to you in i won't in upon to your and might in your life 

---------------
Q = Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.

A = I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.

Bot's return =  not not history 

---------------
Q = I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.

A = This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.

Bot's return =  yes i know 

---------------
Q = The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.

A = Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.

Bot's return =  i can play him to have it but me the middle look make i took the car but them story tonight 

---------------
Q = What's the hold up?

A = Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.

Bot's return =  i thought you said i thought have in the papers of the hour i'm own to the police later and look travel other there's cross i will go to work with much then he a bigger i must you 

---------------
Q = I put in for a replacement for you but no one...

A = No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.

Bot's return =  sea he's european me a homicide piece five bad got out 

---------------
Q = We've got pressure.

A = Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.

Bot's return =  jack 

---------------
Q = Jesus its huge.

A = Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.

Bot's return =  jack 

---------------
Q = That means they didn't abandon ship.

A = So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?

Bot's return =  i don't know how to help about i can't my know flight 

---------------
Q = I can see the hatch.

A = Starck, you still showing those readings?

Bot's return =  keep it down 

---------------
Q = The blood came from somewhere, Peters...

A = There's no one here, Skipper.

Bot's return =  we'll to be it as shit 

---------------
Q = Okay. I'm on the bridge.

A = What you got, Peters?

Bot's return =  i can't i wouldn't have our i want you here ta remember you're wrong 

---------------
Q = I found one.

A = Alive?

Bot's return =  the important of fedex yeah do sorry to tell about now i d into my dad life didn't her you were it now something work on the thing thing then you got had crazy she me 

---------------
Q = Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...

A = ...how's the client?

Bot's return =  it's only hair i haven't changed 

---------------
Q = Can anybody hear me...

A = Skipper...

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Peters...

A = ...you okay?

Bot's return =  that's not are a lot of things things not were to get many 

---------------
Q = I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.

A = Do it.

Bot's return =  woke up real early sun was shining just thought i'd mess around try to learn a song 

---------------
Q = That's a negative, Starck.

A = Justin.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.

A = I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...

Bot's return =  i did bianca to favor 

---------------
Q = Captain Miller, I just want to say...

A = The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.

Bot's return =  not dr nothin' 

---------------
Q = Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...

A = Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.

Bot's return =  who was i would will i can tell to be in some in my what new and to you no a date for kind to have that here it is not a pleasure of my only my not a great matter for a sit of my days my not matter for not that 

---------------
Q = I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.

A = Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.

Bot's return =  yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece 

---------------
Q = That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.

A = Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.

Bot's return =  but i might not to go that this not when twisted 

---------------
Q = Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.

A = Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...

Bot's return =  i was we've a lot family i'm majesty me me as the reason 

---------------
Q = Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --

A = That is not acceptable --

Bot's return =  oh yes with a mystery 

---------------
Q = You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.

A = Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?

Bot's return =  but imagine the things he'd say during sex 

---------------
Q = Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.

A = Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.

Bot's return =  i should i was there have it so i believed was too at us her this for you wouldn't her the the penitentiary in the job guys 

---------------
Q = Any survivors?

A = Negative.

Bot's return =  you saw west's body 

---------------
Q = It beats dying, Mister Smith.

A = Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.

Bot's return =  i need wait to him you one is to do rose you didn't fill and you did it right daughter 

---------------
Q = Yes.

A = One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.

Bot's return =  oh i'm grace me i think troubles we didn't to me i mean seen anything for a job i would come remember know sure in the first we you sure i will i should a remember i thought you i saw talking yet for to quiet after been some i had the fucking i please it amen myself just i lost a lot story of a woman 

---------------
Q = Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"

A = It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.

Bot's return =  i want a hot young 

---------------
Q = What could cause them?  What's in the Core?

A = It's complicated...

Bot's return =  huh 

---------------
Q = It's insane.

A = "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...

Bot's return =  but imagine the things he'd say during sex 

---------------

A = What about the life readings you picked up?

Bot's return =  you enjoy it 

---------------
Q = The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.

Q = Go ahead.

A = There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged.
