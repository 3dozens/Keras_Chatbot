Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

I am trying to generate a random value with Java, but in a specific range.  For example: My range is 5-10, meaning that 5 is the smallest possible value and 10 is the biggest. Any other number in between these numbers is possible to be a value, too.  In Java, there is a method  in the  class, which returns a  value between 0.0 and 1.0. In the class  there is the method , which returns a random  value in the range of 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive). I couldn't find a method, which returns a random integer value between two numbers. I have tried the following things, but I still have problems: (minimum and maximum are the smallest and biggest numbers). Solution 1:  Problem:  can be bigger than .

I've encountered an error deploying a site to a server.  When trying to load the home page, or access authentication on the new site in IIS, I get the error:  Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path.   This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. Locking is   either by default (overrideModeDefault="Deny"), or set explicitly by a   location tag with overrideMode="Deny" or the legacy   allowOverride="false".  More detail can be found here, in Scenario 7 matches my hex error code. The solution given on the linked site above is to set Allow for overrideModeDefault in the section mentioned in my error, in the applicationHost.config file.  In my case,  under Security in system.webServer.  But if I look at the applicationHost.config on my local computer, where the site is properly deployed already, that section is set to Deny. If this solution is correct, how is my local instance running just fine with the same web.config?  According to my applicationHost.config, that section should be locked, but it's not.  I'd prefer to not change the applicationHost.config file, because there are many other sites running on that server.  Is there another solution?

I've been wondering whether there is a good "git export" solution that creates a copy of a tree without the  repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:   followed by removing the  repository directory.  alludes to this functionality but starts with "Just read the desired tree into the index..." which I'm not entirely sure how to do.  is a third party script that essentially does a  into a temporary location followed by  into the final destination.  None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to  might be option 1, because both those require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.

I'd like to go back and review yesterday's stashed changes, but  appears to remove all references to the associated commit. I know that if I use  then .git/refs/stash contains the reference of the commit used to create the stash. And .git/logs/refs/stash contains the whole stash. But those references are gone after . I know that the commit is still in my repository somewhere, but I don't know what it was. Is there an easy way to recover yesterday's stash commit reference? Note that this isn't critical for me today because I have daily backups and can go back to yesterday's working tree to get my changes. I'm asking because there must be an easier way!

I am trying to write a simple application that gets updated. For this I need a simple function that can download a file and show the current progress in a . I know how to do the , but I'm not sure how to display the current progress and how to download the file in the first place.
It is discouraged to simply catch . Instead, only the "known" exceptions should be caught. Now, this sometimes leads to unneccessary repetitive code, for example:  I wonder: Is there a way to catch both exceptions and only call the  call once? The given example is rather simple, as it's only a . But imagine code where you modify an object multiple times, and if one of the manipulations fail in an expected way, you want to "reset" the . However, if there is an unexpected exception, I still want to throw that higher.

I've read this answer, reducing boilerplate, looked at few GitHub examples and even tried redux a little bit (todo apps).  As I understand, official redux doc motivations provide pros comparing to traditional MVC architectures. BUT it doesn't provide an answer to the question:  Why you should use Redux over Facebook Flux?  Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing? Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who comes from functional languages?  To answer this question you may compare complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux. Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:  Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in fb flux?) Rendering on the server (fb flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?) Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in fb flux? What's the benefits?) Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?) Undo/Redo functionality Any other points? Like persisting state...
How do I center a div of one column size within the container (12 columns) in Twitter Bootstrap 3. Please see the starter fiddle.   So, I want a , with a class  to be centered within the container. I may use a row if there are multiple divs, but for now I just want a div with size of one column centered within the container (12 columns). I am also not sure the above approach is good enough as the intention is not to offset the  by half. I do not need free spaces outside the  and the contents of the  shrink in proportion. I want to empty space outside the div to be evenly distributed (shrink till the container width == one column).

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

When embedding JavaScript in an HTML document, where is the proper place to put the  tags and included JavaScript? I seem to recall that you are not supposed to place these in the  section, but placing at the beginning of the  section is bad, too, since the JavaScript will have to be parsed before the page is rendered completely (or something like that). This seems to leave the end of the  section as a logical place for  tags. So, where is the right place to put the  tags? (This question references this question, in which it was suggested that JavaScript function calls should be moved from  tags to  tags. I'm specifically using jQuery, but more general answers are also appropriate.)

I am trying to generate a random value with Java, but in a specific range.  For example: My range is 5-10, meaning that 5 is the smallest possible value and 10 is the biggest. Any other number in between these numbers is possible to be a value, too.  In Java, there is a method  in the  class, which returns a  value between 0.0 and 1.0. In the class  there is the method , which returns a random  value in the range of 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive). I couldn't find a method, which returns a random integer value between two numbers. I have tried the following things, but I still have problems: (minimum and maximum are the smallest and biggest numbers). Solution 1:  Problem:  can be bigger than .

I have got a 2.67  GHz Celeron processor, and 1.21  GB of RAM on a x86 Windows XP Professional machine.  My understanding is that the Android Emulator should start fairly quickly on such a machine, but for me, it does not.

I've got two branches that are fully merged together. However, after the merge is done, I realise that one file has been messed up by the merge (someone else did an auto-format, gah), and it would just be easier to change to the new version in the other branch, and then re-insert my one line change after bringing it over into my branch. So what's the easiest way in git to do this?
Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:  Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: . The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):  A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it "a dramatic design flaw" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?) Edit:  Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:  To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or "together" with it? Doing the binding inside the function would mean that  is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the  line would be "hybrid" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time. The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.
I know references are syntactic sugar, so code is easier to read and write. But what are the differences?  Summary from answers and links below:  A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference cannot be re-seated after binding. Pointers can point nowhere (), whereas reference always refer to an object. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers. There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in ).  To clarify a misconception:  The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must   implement references, but every C++ compiler implements   references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as:  if it's not optimized away entirely, allocates the same amount of storage   as a pointer, and places the address   of  into that storage.  So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory. As a general rule,  Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces. Use pointers to implement algorithms and data structures.  Interesting read:  My all-time favorite C++ FAQ lite. References vs. Pointers. An Introduction to References. References and const.

Currently I use checks in the  loop to detect and over-write old revs from the resultset. But is this the only method to achieve the result? Isn't there a SQL solution? Update As the answers suggest, there is a SQL solution, and here a sqlfiddle demo.  Update 2 I noticed after adding the above sqlfiddle, the rate at which the question is upvoted has surpassed the upvote rate of the answers. That has not been the intention! The fiddle is based on the answers, especially the accepted answer.

After installing Visual Studio 2012 and opening my solution I get a series of errors in this form:  The Web Application Project Foo is configured to use IIS.   Unable to access the IIS metabase. You do not have sufficient privilege to access IIS web sites on your machine.  I get this for each of our web applications.  Things I have tried:  Running Visual Studio as Administrator  Running aspnet_regiis.exe -ga MyUserName  Running aspnet_regiis.exe -i  These seem to be common solutions for this problem but I have not had any success with them.  Is there anything else I can try to do?
I upgraded to Xcode 6 beta 4 and now my App continuously crashes with the message  Unknown class X in Interface Builder file.  It crashes because supposedly Xcode can't find my custom classes that I have linked in my Storyboard but it shows that they are linked correctly in the Xcode interface. I've spent hours trying to figure this out, but nothing works! I'm positive everything is linked correctly. My only other option may be to delete the entire storyboard file and start from scratch because it might be corrupted somehow. Edit: I would also like to add that I tried cleaning, reseting simulator, messing with build phases etc. None of that works.
I find myself repeatedly looking for a clear definition of the differences of , , and  in Ruby on Rails.  Here's the closest I've come:   objects are false, empty, or a whitespace string. For example, , , , , and  are blank.  objects are instances of NilClass.  objects are class-specific, and the definition varies from class to class. A string is empty if it has no characters, and an array is empty if it contains no items.  Is there anything missing, or a tighter comparison that can be made?

My version of node is always v0.6.1-pre even after I install brew node and NVM install v0.6.19. My node version is:  NVM says this (after I install a version of node for the first time in one bash terminal):  But when I restart bash, this is what I see:  So where is this phantom node 0.6.1-pre version and how can I get rid of it? I'm trying to install libraries via NPM so that I can work on a project. I tried using BREW to update before NVM, using "brew update" and "brew install node".  I've tried deleting the "node" directory in my /usr/local/include and the "node" and "node_modules" in my "/usr/local/lib". I've tried uninstalling npm and reinstalling it following these instructions. All of this because I was trying to update an older version of node to install the "zipstream" library. Now there's folders in my users directory, and the node version STILL isn't up to date, even though NVM says it's using 0.6.19. Ideally, I'd like to uninstall nodejs, npm, and nvm, and just reinstall the entire thing from scratch on my system.

I'm developing a new RESTful webservice for our application. When doing a GET on certain entities, clients can request the contents of the entity. If they want to add some parameters (for example sorting a list) they can add these parameters in the query string. Alternatively I want people to be able to specify these parameters in the request body.  HTTP/1.1 does not seem to explicitly forbid this. This will allow them to specify more information, might make it easier to specify complex xml requests. My questions:  Is this a good idea altogether? Will HTTP clients have issues with using request bodies within a GET request?  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

I'm having a hard time getting my head around font scaling. I currently have this site with a body  of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16px.  I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16px whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full blown widescreen desktop. How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using  but this doesn't scale either. My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px  of  among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (E.g in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.) I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as WELL as having extra breakpoints, otherwise I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100px decrease in width to control the text.

When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.  But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a  representing the name of the team, etc.. So then I think:  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a ) and a running total of scores (an ). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is , so I will inherit from it:   But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from . I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects. Why not? Apparently  is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend ? What exactly will break? Another reason I've seen is that  is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a "public API". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from  and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have? Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change? And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from , why didn't they make the class ? What else am I supposed to use? Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a  class which should be extended instead of . But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as , for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow  not better than no ? Inheriting from  is way more work than inheriting from , and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting  is actually not the right solution for my problem. I've seen suggestions such as implementing . Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing. Lastly, some suggest wrapping the  in something:   There are two problems with this:  It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call  instead of just . Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal ... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work? It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't "have" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say "John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players". You say "John has joined SomeTeam". You don't add a letter to "a string's characters", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.  I realize that what happens "under the hood" can be said to be "adding X to Y's internal list", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world. My question (summarized) What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, "logically" (that is to say, "to the human mind") is just a  of  with a few bells and whistles? Is inheriting from  always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from  or not?

Today I needed a simple algorithm for checking if a number is a power of 2. The algorithm needs to be:  Simple Correct for any  value.  I came up with this simple algorithm:  But then I thought, how about checking if  is an exactly round number? But when I checked for 2^63+1,  returned exactly 63 because of rounding. So I checked if 2 to the power 63 is equal to the original number - and it is, because the calculation is done in s and not in exact numbers:  This returned  for the given wrong value: . Is there a better algorithm?

Is there a way to make the following return true?  There doesn't seem to be an overload that allows me to set the case sensitivity.. Currently I UPPERCASE them both, but that's just silly. UPDATE The sillyness I refer to is the i18n issues that come with up- and down casing. UPDATE This question is ancient and since then I have realized I asked for a simple answer for a really vast and difficult topic if you care to investigate it fully. For most cases, in mono-lingual, English code bases this answer will suffice. I'm suspecting because most people coming here fall in this category this is the most popular answer. This answer however brings up the inherent problem that we can't compare text case insensitive until we know both texts are the same culture and we know  what that culture is. This is maybe a less popular answer, but I think it is more correct and that's why I marked it as such.

I am attempting to debug an application on a Motorola Droid, but I am having some difficulty connecting to the device via USB. My development server is a Windows 7 64-bit VM running in Hyper-V, and so I cannot connect directly via USB in the guest or from the host. I installed a couple of different USB-over-TCP solutions, but the connection appears to have issues since the ADB monitor reports "devicemonitor failed to start monitoring" repeatedly. Is there a way to connect directly from the client on the development machine to the daemon on the device using the network instead of the USB connection or possibly another viable options?

I'm looking for a way to enable token-based authentication in Jersey. I am trying not to use any particular framework. Is that possible? My plan is: A user signs up for my web service, my web service generates a token, sends it to the client, and the client will retain it. Then the client, for each request, will send the token instead of username and password. I was thinking of using a custom filter for each request and  but I just thought that this causes a lot of requests to the database to check if the token is valid. Or not create filter and in each request put a param token?  So that each API first checks the token and after executes something to retrieve resource.

[EDIT: I now know that you want a  inside of a , and the trick is to programatically set the content size of the  to the frame size of the .] Then what needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field? Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder.  I'd like to only write code for what needs it. Note: the  (or ) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (), which needs to function as normal.  Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.   I've got it working where I change the frame size of the  when the keyboard goes up and down.  I'm simply using:   However this doesn't automatically "move up" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

If I'm using terminal and typing in a line of text for a command, is there a hotkey or any way to clear/delete that line? For example, if my current line/command is something really long like:  Is there a hotkey or command to go from the above to:  ? Usually I will press the ↓ key, and if my current line is a brand new one on the history, that will clear it.  But if I'm going through my command history via the ↑ key and start editing or using those commands, ↓ will only change the prompt to the next newest command in history, so it doesn't work here unless I press ↓ multiple times.

I'm not that into dynamic programming languages, but I've written my fair share of JavaScript code. I never really got my head around this prototype-based programming, does any one know how this works?   I remember a lot discussion I had with people a while back (I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing) but as I understand it, there's no concept of a class. It's just an object, and instances of those objects are clones of the original, right? But what is the exact purpose of this  property in JavaScript? How does it relate to instantiating objects?

I'm aware of the Gradient Descent and the Back-propagation Theorem. What I don't get is: When is using a bias important and how do you use it? For example, when mapping the  function, when I use 2 inputs and 1 output, it does not give the correct weights, however, when I use 3 inputs (1 of which is a bias), it gives the correct weights.
It is currently said that MD5 is partially unsafe. Taking this into consideration, I'd like to know which mechanism to use for password protection. This question, Is “double hashing” a password less secure than just hashing it once?  suggests that hashing multiple times may be a good idea, whereas How to implement password protection for individual files? suggests using salt. I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a constant number of characters.  The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP It must be safe It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?)  Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer? In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password protection mechanism.

I stumbled upon Stack Overflow question Memory leak with std::string when using std::list<std::string>, and one of the comments says this:  Stop using  so much. I can't see any reason you used new anywhere   you did. You can create objects by value in C++ and it's one of the   huge advantages to using the language. You do not have to allocate   everything on the stack*. Stop thinking like a Java programmer.  I'm not really sure what he means by that. Why should objects be created by value in C++ as often as possible, and what difference does it make internally? Did I misinterpret the answer?  * The comment originally said "stack", this has since been corrected by a moderator to the intended "heap".

The  API on Android seems like it's a bit of a pain to use for an application that only needs an occasional and rough approximation of the user's location. The app I'm working on isn't really a location app per se, but it does need to get the user's location in order to display a list of nearby businesses.  It doesn't need to worry about if the user is moving around or anything like that. Here's what I'd like to do:  Show the user a list of nearby locations. Preload the user's location so that by the time I need it in  X, it will be available. I don't particularly care about accuracy or frequency of update. Just grabbing one location is sufficient as long as it's not way off. Maybe if I want to be fancy I'll update the location once every few mins or so, but it's not a huge priority. Work for any device as long as it has either a GPS or a Network Location provider.  It seems like it shouldn't be that hard, but it appears to me that I have to spin up two different location providers (GPS and NETWORK) and manage each's lifecycle. Not only that, but I have to duplicate the same code in multiple activities to satisfy #2. I've tried using  in the past to cut the solution down to just using one location provider, but that seems to only give you the best "theoretical" provider rather than the provider that's actually going to give you the best results. Is there a simpler way to accomplish this?

I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the  activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.  The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and . This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the  for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera. The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.  Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bit wise)?   This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with touch screen because of focus issue. (I can use roller ball.)  I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.  As soon as I disabled the image on the list view it worked fine again. FYI: This is how I was doing it:  Where  is a . Here is my LogCat:  I also have a new error when displaying an image:

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

I'd like to get the number of commits of my Git repository, a bit like SVN revision numbers. The goal is to use it as a unique, incrementing build number. I currently do like that, on Unix/Cygwin/msysGit:  But I feel it's a bit of a hack. Is there a better way to do that? It would be cool if I actually didn't need  or even Git, so it could work on a bare Windows. Just read a file or a directory structure...

When I try opening Eclipse, a pop-up dialog states:  Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:/JDK/bin/client/jvm.dll"`.  Following this, Eclipse force closes. Here's a few points I'd like to make:    I checked to see if anything exists at that path. It does exist.   My Eclipse and Java SE Development Kit are both 64-bit. I checked my system, and it can handle 64-bit.   I've searched for this problem on Google and on Stack Overflow, and the only answer I found was to download the 32-bit versions of JDK and Eclipse.  Downloading the 32-bit versions is something I only want to do as a very last resort. What would be suggested to solve this issue?

This crash has been a blocking issue, basically I used following steps to reproduce the issue:  Create a Cocoa Touch Framework project Add a swift file and a class Dog Build framework for device Create a Single View application in Swift Import framework into app project Instantiate swift class from the framework in ViewController Build and run app on device  The app immediate crashed upon launching, here is console log:  I have tried to build on iOS 7.1 and 8.0 devices, they both have the same crash. However I can build app and run on simulator fine. Also I am aware that I can change the framework to from Required to Optional in Link Binary With Libraries, but it did not completely resolve the problem, the app crashed when I create an instance of Dog. The behavior is different on device and simulator, I suspect that we can't distribute framework for device using beta version of Xcode. Can anyone shed light on this?
I'm using the PostgreSql app for mac (http://postgresapp.com/). I've used it in the past on other machines but it's giving me some trouble when installing on my macbook. I've installed the application and I ran:  It returns:  It seems I can't even run the console to create the database that it's attempting to find. The same thing happens when I just run:  or if I launch psql from the application drop down menu: Machine stats:  OSX 10.8.4 psql (PostgreSQL) 9.2.4  Any help is appreciated.  I've also attempted to install PostgreSql via homebrew and I'm getting the same issue. I've also read the applications documentation page that states:   When Postgres.app first starts up, it creates the $USER database,   which is the default database for psql when none is specified. The   default user is $USER, with no password.  So it would seem the application is not creating $USER however I've installed->uninstalled-reinstalled several times now so it must be something with my machine. I found the answer but I'm not sure exactly how it works as the user who answered on this thread -> Getting Postgresql Running In Mac: Database "postgres" does not exist didn't follow up. I used the following command to get psql to open:   I'll leave this one unanswered until someone can provide an explanation for why this works.

IE9 Bug - JavaScript only works after opening developer tools once. Our site offers free pdf downloads to users, and it has a simple "enter password to download" function. However, it doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer.  You can see for yourself in this example. The download pass is "makeuseof". In any other browser, it works fine. In IE, both buttons do nothing.  The most curious thing I've found is that if you open and close the developer toolbar with F12, it all suddenly starts to work.  We've tried compatibility mode and such, nothing makes a difference. How do I make this work in Internet Explorer?

I have a file a xyz.cpp. I want to open two instances of a this file in Visual studio (btw I am using 2005). Why would I want to do so? I want to compare two sections of the same file side by side. I know workarounds such as:  Make a copy of the file. But the problem is that its not elegant and I dont want to  make copies everytime I faced with this.  I can split the window into two. The problem with split it than I can split it horizontally only. The result of horizontal split is that right half my screen is white space.   If I were able to split it vertically or open two instances of the same file, it would increase the number of lines of code I can compare.

I understand that JPA 2 is a specification and Hibernate is a tool for ORM. Also, I understand that Hibernate has more features than JPA 2. But from a practical point of view, what really is the difference?  I have experience using iBatis and now I'm trying to learn either Hibernate or JPA2. I picked up Pro JPA2 book and it keeps referring to "JPA provider". For example:  If you think a feature should be standardized, you should speak up   and request it from your JPA provider  This confuses me so I have a few questions:  Using JPA2 alone can I fetch data from DB by simply annotating my POJO's Is JPA2 supposed to be used with a "JPA Provider" e.g TopLink or Hibernate? If so, then what's the benefit of using JPA2 + Hibernate as compared to Hibernate alone? Can you recommend a good practical JPA2 book. "Pro JPA2" seems more like a bible and reference on JPA2 (It doesn't get into Queries until the later half of the book). Is there a book that takes a problem/solution approach to JPA2?

C# desktop application on express edition. Worked then didn't work 5 seconds later. I tried the following.  Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug info are set on all assemblies. Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLLs related to the project from my entire machine. Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch. Reboot.  I have two WinForms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug info, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug info on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?  I want to add in here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.
I am hoping to make this question and the answers to it the definitive guide to dealing with daylight saving time, in particular for dealing with the actual change overs.  If you have anything to add, please do Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards. For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.  How have you dealt with the daylight saving issue?  What assumptions are part of your solution? (looking for context here)  As important, if not more so:  What did you try that did not work?  Why did it not work?  I would be interested in programming, OS, data persistence and other pertinent aspects of the issue. General answers are great, but I would also like to see details especially if they are only available on one platform.
I've got some Java code with SQL statements written as Java strings (please no OR/M flamewars, the embedded SQL is what it is - not my decision). I've broken the SQL statements semantically into several concatenated strings over several lines of code for ease of maintenance. So instead of something like:  I have something like:  This style makes the SQL much easier to read and maintain (IMHO), especially for larger queries. For example, I can put my editor into "overwrite" mode and modify the text in-place fairly easily. Note that this issue generalizes beyond the particular example of SQL. Any code that is written with any vertical formatting, particularly tabular constructs, is susceptible to destruction by a pretty printer. Now, some project members use the Eclipse editor and the semantic formatting is often destroyed when they format an entire source file. Is there a way to instruct Eclipse to ignore certain lines of source with respect to formatting? I'm looking for something like a special comment that toggles the Eclipse formatter. Ideally, such a comment could be configurable to be whatever we choose, and other formatters could be programmed to respect it as well:  Obviously, one "solution" is to have our team members standardize on some external formatter like Jalopy or JIndent, but that's not what this question is about (also, not my decision on this project): I'm specifically looking for a way to avoid the Eclipse formatter on an ad-hoc basis. Ideally, a solution will allow me to insert instructions for the Eclipse formatter without requiring team members using Eclipse to do any IDE reconfiguration (other than possibly choosing a formatter agnostic command comment:  → ).

Why are the errors not displaying on the actual php page?

Say I have an array of a few objects:  How can I sort this array by the date element in order from the date closest to the current date and time down? Keep in mind that the array may have many objects, but for the sake of simplicity I used 2. Would I use the sort function and a custom comparator? UPDATE In my specific case, I wanted the dates arranged from the most recent to the oldest. It ended up that I had to reverse the simple function's logic as so:  This sorts the dates from the most recent.

I'm starting with git and GitHub and there's a project I'm watching on GitHub. I unintentionally clicked to fork it. Now it appears as a new project to me. I have some doubts about it:  I know if commit or do another thing to my forked repo, it will be updated, but the updated code will take effect only after the project's author request the pull. Right? If I go to admin panel on GitHub there's a delete option. If I delete it as the option above, will it make any effect in the original one or not?  I'd like to delete it. By now I'm just studying the code and don't really need the fork.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsert Insert Update stored proc on SQL Server Is there some clever way to do this in SQLite that I have not thought of?

I have a limited exposure to DB and have only used DB as an application programmer. I want to know about Clustered and Non clustered indexes. I googled and what I found was :  A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders  the way   records in the table are physically   stored.  Therefore table can have only   one clustered index. The leaf  nodes   of a clustered index contain the data   pages. A nonclustered index is a   special type of index in which  the   logical order of the index does not   match the physical  stored order of   the rows on disk. The leaf node of a    nonclustered index does not consist of   the data pages.  Instead, the leaf   nodes contain index rows.  What I found in SO was What are the differences between a clustered and a non-clustered index?. Can someone explain this in plain English?

Consider this:  So I assumed this would update the value of  (and add 'c': 3) also since I was doing a shallow copy. Like if you do it for a list:  This works as expected.

What doesn't appear to update however is the 2nd view, the 'B' remains, it should display 'Y' after pressing the update button.
I have inserted records into a SQL Server database table. The table had a primary key defined and the auto increment identity seed is set to “Yes”. This is done primarily because in SQL Azure, each table has to have a primary key and identity defined.  But since I have to delete some records from the table, the identity seed for those tables will be disturbed and the index column (which is auto-generated with an increment of 1) will get disturbed. How can I reset the identity column after I deleted the records so that the column has sequence in ascending numerical order? The identity column is not used as a foreign key anywhere in database.

I'm a bit confused about how Java generics handle inheritance / polymorphism. Assume the following hierarchy - Animal (Parent) Dog - Cat (Children) So suppose I have a method . By all the rules of inheritance and polymorphism, I would assume that a  is a  and a  is a  - and so either one could be passed to this method. Not so. If I want to achieve this behavior, I have to explicitly tell the method to accept a list of any subset of Animal by saying .  I understand that this is Java's behavior. My question is why? Why is polymorphism generally implicit, but when it comes to generics it must be specified?

This has been driving me crazy for a couple of days now, but in reality it's a problem that I've hit off and on for the last few years: With HTML/CSS how can I make an element that has a width and/or height that is 100% of it's parent element and still has proper padding or margins? By "proper" I mean that if my parent element is  tall and I specify  with  I would expect that I should get a  high element with  on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element. Now, I know that that's not how the standard box model specifies it should work (although I'd like to know why, exactly...), so the obvious answer doesn't work:  But it would seem to me that there must be SOME way of reliably producing this effect for a parent of arbitrary size. Does anyone know of a way of accomplishing this (seemingly simple) task? Oh, and for the record I'm not terribly interested in IE compatibility so that should (hopefully) make things a bit easier.  EDIT: Since an example was asked for, here's the simplest one I can think of:  The challenge is then to get the black box to show up with a 25 pixel padding on all edges without the page growing big enough to require scrollbars.

I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:   &  are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call // after fetching all the dependencies.  is like , but builds flattened dependencies trees (unlike  which do it recursively). Meaning  fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while  expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes  and  are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter on front-end).  and  are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).  vs.  (is like  vs.  or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster.   () - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers.  / + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use / over  + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. "on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp").  allows packaging node modules for browsers.  vs 's  is actually AMD vs CommonJS.  Questions:  What is  & ? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference? Where would you use ? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?  When would you use / over  + plugins? Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

The short: is there a way to have a git repo push to and pull from a list of remote repos (rather than a single "origin")? The long: I often have a situation when I'm developing an app in multiple computers, with different connectivity -- say a laptop while on transit, a computer "A" while I'm in a certain location, and another computer "B" while on another. Also, the laptop might have connectivity with only either "A" or "B", and sometimes both. What I would like to is for git to always "pull" from and "push" to all the computers it can currently connect to, so it's easier to jump from one machine to the other and continue working seamlessly.

Consider this example (typical in OOP books):   I have an  class, where each  can have many friends. And subclasses like , ,  etc which add specific behavior like ,  etc. Here's the  class:  And here's some code snippet with lots of typecasting:  Is there any way I can use generics for the return type to get rid of the typecasting, so that I can say      Here's some initial code with return type conveyed to the method as a parameter that's never used.   Is there a way to figure out the return type at runtime without the extra parameter using ? Or at least by passing a class of the type instead of a dummy instance. I understand generics are for compile time type-checking, but is there a workaround for this?

I'm working on a little personal todo list app and so far everything has been working quite well. There is one little quirk I'd like to figure out. Whenever I go to add a new item, I have a Dialog with an EditText view showing inside. When I select the EditText view, the keyboard comes up to enter text, as it should. In most applications, the default seems to be that the shift key is held for the first letter... although it does not do this for my view. There has to be a simple way to fix, but I've searched the reference repeatedly and cannot find it. I'm thinking there has to be an xml attribute for the reference loaded by the Adapter, but I can't find out what it is.

Platform: IntelliJ Community Edition 10.0.3 SDK: jdk1.6.0_21 OS: Windows 7 So I have a strange situation with IntelliJ that has me completely stumped.  I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file.  The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run. I then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows.  Maven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository. I then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents). Finally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency).  I now create a new class as follows:  Now for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: "Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'", BUT Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too). So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 ("Go To Declaration") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports. Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the "Projects" window the "com.hunnysoft.jmime" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under "Libraries".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks. It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK). As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project. Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.  I don't see anything unusual in this jar file. My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing). So, anyone have any IDEAs?

Here is a function I was working on to programmatically lighten or darken a hex color by a specific amount. Just pass in a string like "3F6D2A" for the color (col) and an base10 integer (amt) for the amount to lighten or darken. To darken, pass in a negative number (i.e. -20). The reason for me to do this was because of all the solutions I found, thus far, they seemed to over-complicate the issue. And I had a feeling it could be done with just a couple lines of code. Please let me know if you find any problems, or have any adjustments to make that would speed it up.  For Development use here is an easier to read version:  And finally a version to handle colors that may (or may not) have the "#" in the beginning. Plus adjusting for improper color values:  OK, so now its not just a couple of lines, but it seems far simpler and if you're not using the "#" and don't need to check for colors out of range, it is only a couple of lines.  If not using the "#", you can just add it in code like:  I guess my main question is, am I correct here? Does this not encompass some (normal) situations?
Could someone explain to me the meaning of  and  in python? I need to know the difference and the meaning.  As far as I understand,  tells a class that it's a method which should be inherited into subclasses, or... something. However, what's the point of that? Why not just define the class method without adding  or  or any  definitions? tl;dr: when should I use them, why should I use them, and how should I use them? I'm pretty advanced with C++, so using more advanced programming concepts shouldn't be a problem. Feel free giving me a corresponding C++ example if possible.

I'm using Core Data to locally persist results from a Web Services call. The web service returns the full object model for, let's say, "Cars" - could be about 2000 of them (and I can't make the Web Service return anything less than 1 or ALL cars. The next time I open my application, I want to refresh the Core Data persisted copy by calling the Web Service for all Cars again, however to prevent duplicates I would need to purge all data in the local cache first. Is there a quicker way to purge ALL instances of a specific entity in the managed object context (e.g. all entities of type "CAR"), or do I need to query them call, then iterate through the results to delete each, then save? Ideally I could just say delete all where entity is Blah.
I'm trying to work out an appropriate singleton model for usage in Swift. So far, I've been able to get a non-thread safe model working as:  Wrapping the singleton instance in the Static struct should allow a single instance that doesn't collide with singleton instances without complex naming schemings, and it should make things fairly private. Obviously though, this model isn't thread safe, so I tried to add dispatch_once to the whole thing:  But I get a compiler error on the  line:  Cannot convert the expression's type 'Void' to type '()'  I've tried several different variants of the syntax, but they all seem to have the same results:  What is the proper usage of  using Swift?

In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:  When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS   to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the   style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript   includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before   continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering   thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the   styles it needs.  My actual testing reveals something quite different:  My test harness I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:   The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example,  gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.  I use the following page to test.  When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:   When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:   I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter. What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.  Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?  It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

I am trying to make a simple Coffee Calculator. I need to display the amount of coffee in grams. The "g" symbol for grams needs to be attached to my UILabel that I am using to display the amount. The numbers in the UILabel are changing dynamically with user input just fine, but I need to add a lower case "g" on the end of the string that is formatted differently from the  updating numbers. The "g" needs to be attached to the numbers so that as the number size and position changes, the "g" "moves" with the numbers. I'm sure this problem has been solved before so a link in the right direction would be helpful as I've googled my little heart out. I've searched through the documentation for an attributed string and I even downloded an "Attributed String Creator" from the app store, but the resulting code is in Objective-C and I am using Swift. What would be awesome, and probably helpful to other developers learning this language, is a clear example of creating a custom font with custom attributes using an attributed string in Swift. The documentation for this is very confusing as there is not a very clear path on how to do so. My plan is to create the attributed string and add it to the end of my coffeeAmount string.  Where calculatedCoffee is an Int converted to a string and "attributedText" is the lowercase "g" with customized font that I am trying to create. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Any help is appreciated!

I am trying to get my first taste of Android development using Eclipse. I ran into this problem when trying to run Eclipse, having installed version 4.2 only minutes ago. After first trying to start Eclipse without any parameters to specify the Java VM, I got an error message saying it couldn't find a Java VM called javaw.exe inside the Eclipse folder, so I found where Java was installed and specified that location as the parameter in the shortcut's target. Now I get a different error, "Java was started but returned exit code=13". Similar questions seem to indicate that it's a 32-bit/64-bit conflict, but I'm 99% positive that I downloaded 64-bit versions of both Eclipse and Java (RE 7u5), which I chose because I have 64-bit Windows 7.

I've noticed this pattern in a lot of Android apps and games recently: when clicking the back button to "exit" the application, a  comes up with a message similar to "Please click BACK again to exit". I was wondering, as I'm seeing it more and more often, is that a built-in feature that you can somehow access in an activity? I've looked at the source code of many classes but I can't seem to find anything about that. Of course, I can think about a few ways to achieve the same functionality quite easily (the easiest is probably to keep a boolean in the activity that indicates whether the user already clicked once...) but I was wondering if there's something already here. EDIT: As @LAS_VEGAS mentioned, I didn't really mean "exit" in the traditional meaning. (i.e. terminated) I meant "going back to whatever was open before the application start activity was launched", if that makes sense :)

Is there a simple shell command/script that supports excluding certain files/folders from being archived? I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup. Not quite solutions: The  command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files & folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded. I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files.

I have a windows forms app with a textbox control that I want to only accept integer values. In the past I've done this kind of validation by overloading the KeyPress event and just removing characters which didn't fit the specification. I've looked at the MaskedTextBox control but I'd like a more general solution that could work with perhaps a regular expression, or depend on the values of other controls. Ideally this would behave such that pressing a non numeric character would either produce no result or immediately provide the user with feedback about the invalid character.

Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second! Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file. Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations. The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. "Use a transaction!"), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:  A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP. The code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as "Release" with "Full Optimization" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot). I'm using the SQLite "Amalgamation", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).  Let's write some code! The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then will inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this "baseline" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:   The "Control" Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.  Imported 864913 records in 0.94   seconds  Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)  The "Worst-Case-Scenario" We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:  This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?  Imported 864913 records in 9933.61   seconds  Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second. Using a Transaction By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:   Imported 864913 records in 38.03   seconds  That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second. Using a Prepared Statement Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use  to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using :   Imported 864913 records in 16.27   seconds  Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call  and ), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second. PRAGMA synchronous = OFF By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting , we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:   Imported 864913 records in 12.41   seconds  The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second. PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating . Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:   Imported 864913 records in 13.50   seconds  A little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second. PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):   Imported 864913 records in 12.00   seconds  Fantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second. Using an In-Memory Database Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:   Imported 864913 records in 10.94   seconds  It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second. Refactoring C Code Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra  assignment operations in the  loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of  directly into , and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:  Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical  Imported 864913 records in 8.94   seconds  A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.  Summary (so far) I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!  CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX Before we start measuring  performance, we know that we'll be creating indexes. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try: Create Index then Insert Data   Imported 864913 records in 18.13   seconds  Insert Data then Create Index   Imported 864913 records in 13.66   seconds  As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.  I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.

Consider the main axis and cross axis of a flex container:                                                                                                                         Source: W3C To align flex items along the main axis there is one property:    To align flex items along the cross axis there are three properties:      In the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. These are the default directions of a flex container. However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the  property.  (The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.) My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and  makes it easy to switch back and forth.  So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties? Why are  and  consolidated into one property for the main axis? Why does the main axis not get a  property?  Scenarios where these properties would be useful:  placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container  making a group of flex items align-right () but have the first item align left () Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With  the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly ("flexes") to different screen sizes. in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  () and align the adjacent items to the container edges ( and ).  Note that values  and  on  property  will not keep the middle item centered in relation to the container if the adjacent items have different widths.        jsFiddle version  As of this writing, there is no mention of  or  in the flexbox spec. However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:                                                                                                                          Source: W3C You'll notice that  and  are being considered... but not for flexbox.

I have a local git repository called 'skeleton' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:  If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can do  and everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup. What doesn't work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can't get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repo has a 'master' branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repo's 'rails' branch, by default. Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that git wants me to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repos, with the rails skeleton repo tracking the master skeleton repo? And any individual project cloning the rails skeleton repo. Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated!

I originally thought the best way would be to just get the text inside the textarea, and then split it, or should I use the keyup event, convert the keycode returned to an ASCII character, append the character to a string and send the string to the server (then empty the string). I couldn't find any information on getting text from a textarea, all I got was keyup information. Also, how can I convert the keycode returned to an ASCII character?

This probably never happened in the real-world yet, and may never happen, but let's consider this: say you have a git repository, make a commit, and get very very unlucky: one of the blobs ends up having the same SHA-1 as another that is already in your repository.

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

I went to the Environment Variables in 'System' in the control panel and made two new variables, one for user variables and one for system variables.

To be honest, I've tried to turn a dirty trick on IIS and just when I thought that I was going to get away with it, I realized my workaround doesn't work. Here's what I've tried to do: 1) I have ASP.NET application which has Preloader class that inherits IProcessHostPreloadClient and does all the heavy initialization in Preload method implementation (application is complex and it's a part of an enormous system, so it requires approximately 2 minutes to establish connections to all necessary services and pre-instantiate some Unity registrations). 2) I have a lot of work that needs to be done on application shutdown (unsubscribing, disconnecting, disposing,...), and I guess the best place to do it is in *Application_End* method located in Global.asax. 3) Everything works just fine when I have user activity (first request after the Application Pool that contains aforementioned web application is started will cause *Application_Start* to be called and afterwards *Application_End* is called on Application Pool stop or recycle), but problems occur when there is no user activity and application tries to restart itself after being active for 48 hours (configured requirement). Since there was no requests, application officially didn't get started. Ergo, it can't be gracefully stopped since *Application_End* won't be called. 4) Now comes the messy part... I've tried to make a GET request from code at the end of the Preload method, and it worked. But this solution seemed bad to me, even though it worked. So, I've tried a lot of things, and the last thing I tried was this:  ... and that has done it's purpose. *Application_Start* was called, (I've checked response, it was containing login page that was supposed to be displayed in initial request) and on Application Pool shutdown application ended gracefully by doing necessary work in *Application_End*. BUT After the application was started (preloaded and initiated) in this manner, this is what happened when I wanted to reach application via Web browser:  HTTP Error 500.21 - Internal Server Error   Handler "ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" has a bad module "ManagedPipelineHandler" in its module list  I am unable to figure this out. Can anybody tell me why this happens and how to fix it? If I don't figure this out, I will go back to first solution (sending GET request from code) but this problem will bug me since I don't even have an idea what's wrong.
I have created a layout that contains two buttons, Next and Previous. In between the buttons I'm generating some dynamic views. So when I first launch the application I want to disable the "Previous" button since there wont be any previous views.

Is there a C# official guideline for the order of items in terms of class structure? Does it go:  Public Fields Private Fields Properties Constructors Methods ?  I'm curious if there is a hard and fast rule about the order of items? I'm kind of all over the place. I want to stick with a particular standard so I can do it everywhere. The real problem is my more complex properties end up looking a lot like methods and they feel out of place at the top before the constructor. Any tips/suggestions?
What is the proper way to modify environment variables like PATH in OSX?

Anybody have any idea where these variables, especially PATH, are defined? Edit: I'm running OS X 10.5
I am doing some numerical optimization on a scientific application. One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call  by compiling it into , but the call  is not optimized and will actually call the library function , which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, Intel C++ Compiler, executable , will eliminate the library call for .)  What I am curious about is that when I replaced  with  using GCC 4.5.1 and options "", it uses 5  instructions:  while if I write , it will produce  which reduces the number of multiply instructions to 3.  has similar behavior. Why do compilers not recognize this optimization trick?

Ok, I'm now banging my head against a brick wall with this one. I have an HTML (not XHTML) document that renders fine in Firefox 3 and IE 7.  It uses fairly basic CSS to style it and renders fine in HTML. I'm now after a way of converting it to PDF.  I have tried:  DOMPDF: it had huge problems with tables.  I factored out my large nested tables and it helped (before it was just consuming up to 128M of memory then dying--thats my limit on memory in php.ini) but it makes a complete mess of tables and doesn't seem to get images.  The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points; HTML2PDF and HTML2PS: I actually had better luck with this.  It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and Htmldoc: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.  I tried a Windows app called Html2Pdf Pilot that actually did a pretty decent job but I need something that at a minimum runs on Linux and ideally runs on-demand via PHP on the Webserver. I really can't believe I'm this stuck.  Am I missing something?

I understand that JPA 2 is a specification and Hibernate is a tool for ORM. Also, I understand that Hibernate has more features than JPA 2. But from a practical point of view, what really is the difference?  I have experience using iBatis and now I'm trying to learn either Hibernate or JPA2. I picked up Pro JPA2 book and it keeps referring to "JPA provider". For example:  If you think a feature should be standardized, you should speak up   and request it from your JPA provider  This confuses me so I have a few questions:  Using JPA2 alone can I fetch data from DB by simply annotating my POJO's Is JPA2 supposed to be used with a "JPA Provider" e.g TopLink or Hibernate? If so, then what's the benefit of using JPA2 + Hibernate as compared to Hibernate alone? Can you recommend a good practical JPA2 book. "Pro JPA2" seems more like a bible and reference on JPA2 (It doesn't get into Queries until the later half of the book). Is there a book that takes a problem/solution approach to JPA2?

Two-part question from an iOS developer learning Android, working on an Android project that will make a variety of requests from JSON to image to streaming download of audio and video:  On iOS I have used the AFNetworking project extensively. Is there an equivalent library for Android? I've read up on OkHTTP and Retrofit by Square, as well as Volley but dont yet have experience developing with them. I'm hoping someone can provide some concrete examples of best use cases for each. From what I've read, seems like OkHTTP is the most robust of the three, and could handle the requirements of this project (mentioned above).

The ExpandoObject class being added to .NET 4 allows you to arbitrarily set properties onto an object at runtime. Are there any advantages to this over using a , or really even a Hashtable?

For example, why is this:  Really better, or substantially different, than:  What real advantages are gained by using ExpandoObject instead of just using an arbitrary dictionary type, other than not being obvious that you're using a type that's going to be determined at runtime.

The height should change automatically if the window is resized. Is this possible? At the moment, Firefox looks like it's making the height fit and then adjusting the width. Is this perhaps because the height is the longest dimension and it's trying to avoid cropping? I want to crop vertically, then scroll: no horizontal repeat. Also, Chrome is placing the image in the centre, no repeat, even when  is given explicitly, which is the default anyway.

I have a local git repository called 'skeleton' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:  If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can do  and everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup. What doesn't work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can't get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repo has a 'master' branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repo's 'rails' branch, by default. Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that git wants me to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repos, with the rails skeleton repo tracking the master skeleton repo? And any individual project cloning the rails skeleton repo. Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated!

So, I must:  Convince him to use Node (he's giving up little ground on that) Figure out how to upload, download, rename, save, etc. files in node or I must install apache and node on the same server.  Which is the most favorable situation, and how do I implement that?
Looking through bootstrap it looks like they support collapsing the menubar items for smaller screens. Is there something similar for other items on the page? For example, I have a  along with nav-pills floated right. On a small screen this causes issues. I'd love to at least put it into a similar click-to-show-more dropdown. Is this possible within existing Bootstrap framework?

What is the quickest way to HTTP GET in Python if I know the content will be a string? I am searching the docs for a quick one-liner like:  But all I can find using Google are  and  - and I am unable to find a shortcut in those libraries.

Is there a good way to adjust the size of a  to conform to its content? Say for instance I have a  that contains one line of text:  I then add another line of text:  Is there a good way in Cocoa Touch to get the  that will hold all of the lines in the text view so that I can adjust the parent view accordingly? As another example, look at the notes' field for events in the Calendar application - note how the cell (and the  it contains) expands to hold all lines of text in the notes' string.

It seems this is a common issue with ReSharper but in this page there are many useful solutions 😃 for you, So if this question is directed you to the solution please don't forget to give +1👍 to the question 😉   My Tools: Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate + Update 1 ReSharper v7.1.25.234 My Solution Build Status: Build Successfully But when I install ReSharper and ReSharper code analysis is enable, many keywords of my code are red with this error: "can not resolve symbol XXX"   Another picture of my project >> The ReSharper “CAN NOT RESOLVE SYMBOL” errors are everywhere, but my project build process is successfully, and it works correctly.  Additional Note: If I disable ReSharper Code Analysis, my project will be Normal, but I want to use ReSharper code analysis.  I tried ReSharper → Options → General → Clear Cache. But I still have this problem!   One month ago, I got these errors when I uninstalled Visual Studio 2012 RC and installed VS 2012 RTM. I've already uninstalled and installed ReSharper again. But I have this problem yet! My solution has five projects >> two loaded projects (main project + resource project) and three unloaded projects   I realize that my Visual Studio also has bigger problems (More information on Stack Overflow)  I can't add any reference to my projects (even inside new solutions and new projects) I can't install any package (by "Packet Manager Console" or Manage NuGet Package) I can't update any package (by "Packet Manager Console" or Manage NuGet Package)  I've done a lot of suggestions (of myself and others)  Re-resister some DLL files Using some windows and registry repair tools Remove ReSharper Repair Visual Studio and...

This is a somewhat bizarre question. My objectives are to understand the language design decision and to identify the possibilities of reflection in C++.  Why C++ language committee did not go towards implementing reflection in the language? Is reflection too difficult in a language that does not run on a virtual machine (like java)? If one were to implement reflection for C++, what will be the challenges?  I guess the uses of reflection are well-known: editors can be more easily written, program code will be smaller, mocks can be generated for unit tests and so on. But it would be great if you could comment on uses of reflection too.

I've created a site using the Zurb Foundation 3 grid. Each page has a large h1. CSS  HTML  When I resize the browser to mobile size the large font doesn't adjust and causes the browser to include a horizontal scroll to accomodate for the large text.

What is the best way to open a file as read/write if it exists, or if it does not, then create it and open it as read/write? From what I read,  should do this, right? It is not working for me (Python 2.6.2) and I'm wondering if it is a version problem, or not supposed to work like that or what. The bottom line is, I just need a solution for the problem. I am curious about the other stuff, but all I need is a nice way to do the opening part. UPDATE: the enclosing directory was writeable by user and group, not other (I'm on a Linux system... so permissions 775 in other words), and the exact error was:  IOError: no such file or directory.

I have a batch file that runs several python scripts that do table modifications.    I want to have users comment out the 1-2 python scripts that they don't want to run, rather than removing them from the batch file (so the next user knows these scripts exist as options!) I also want to add comments to bring to their attention specifically the variables they need to update in the Batch file before they run it. I see that I can use . But it looks like that's more for updating the user with progress after they've run it.    Is there a syntax for more appropriately adding a comment?

I find myself repeatedly looking for a clear definition of the differences of , , and  in Ruby on Rails.  Here's the closest I've come:   objects are false, empty, or a whitespace string. For example, , , , , and  are blank.  objects are instances of NilClass.  objects are class-specific, and the definition varies from class to class. A string is empty if it has no characters, and an array is empty if it contains no items.  Is there anything missing, or a tighter comparison that can be made?

I frequently use  and  to save and restore changes in my working tree. Yesterday I had some changes in my working tree that I had stashed and popped, and then I made more changes to my working tree. I'd like to go back and review yesterday's stashed changes, but  appears to remove all references to the associated commit. I know that if I use  then .git/refs/stash contains the reference of the commit used to create the stash. And .git/logs/refs/stash contains the whole stash. But those references are gone after . I know that the commit is still in my repository somewhere, but I don't know what it was. Is there an easy way to recover yesterday's stash commit reference? Note that this isn't critical for me today because I have daily backups and can go back to yesterday's working tree to get my changes. I'm asking because there must be an easier way!

I have some doubts over how Enumerators work, and LINQ. Consider these two simple selects:  or  I changed the names of my original objects so that this looks like a more generic example. The query itself is not that important. What I want to ask is this:   I noticed that if I use , when I debug and inspect "sel", which in that case is the IEnumerable, it has some interesting members: "inner", "outer", "innerKeySelector" and "outerKeySelector", these last 2 appear to be delegates. The "inner" member does not have "Animal" instances in it, but rather "Species" instances, which was very strange for me. The "outer" member does contain "Animal" instances. I presume that the two delegates determine which goes in and what goes out of it? I noticed that if I use "Distinct", the "inner" contains 6 items (this is incorrect as only 2 are Distinct), but the "outer" does contain the correct values. Again, probably the delegated methods determine this but this is a bit more than I know about IEnumerable. Most importantly, which of the two options is the best performance-wise?  The evil List conversion via ? Or maybe using the enumerator directly? If you can, please also explain a bit or throw some links that explain this use of IEnumerable.
I'm trying to have an image (as the background) on a button and add dynamically, depending on what's happening during run-time, some text above/over the image. If I use  I don't even have the possibility to add text. If I use  I can add text but only define an image with  and similar XML attributes as defined here. However these attributes only combine text & image in x- and y-dimensions, meaning I can draw an image around my text, but not below/under my text (with the z-axis defined as coming out of the display). Any suggestions on how to do this? One idea would be to either extend  or  and override the -method. But with my current level of knowledge I don't really know how to do this (2D rendering). Maybe someone with more experience knows a solution or at least some pointers to start?

Again, after I did this, what would happen now if the other users do ? I guess all this would result in a lot of trouble. Is there a clean way to get what I want? Or should I just leave  as it is and create a new branch  and just work there further on?

In order to duplicate an Array in Javascript, does anyone know (and maybe tested) if it's faster to use: Slice method:  or For loop:   UPDATE: (just to clarify myself) I know both ways do only a shallow copy: if original_array contains references to objects, objects won't be cloned, but only the references will be copied therefore both arrays will have references to the same objects. But this is not the point of this question. I'm asking only about speed.
I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen. The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom. I have a header  and a content . At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so: CSS and HTML       The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required. For anything inside the content div, setting  will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with it's height set to 100%. Putting  inside  will not allow this to work. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the ? Update: Elements inside the content  will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the  will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%. Update 2: For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside  would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

I have been heavily relying on CSS for a website that I am working on. Right now, all the CSS styles are being applied on a per tag basis, and so now I am trying to move it to more of an external styling to help with any future changes. But now the problem is that I have noticed I am getting a "CSS Explosion".  It is becoming difficult for me to decide how to best organize and abstract data within the CSS file. I am using a large number of  tags within the website, moving from a heavily table-based website.  So I'm getting a lot of CSS selectors that look like this:  It's not too bad yet, but as I am a beginner, I was wondering if recommendations could be made on how best to organize the various parts of a CSS file.  I don't want to have a separate CSS attribute for every element on my website, and I always want the CSS file to be fairly intuitive and easy to read. My ultimate goal is to make it easy to use the CSS files and demonstrate their power to increase the speed of web development. This way, other individuals that may work on this site in the future will also get into the practice of using good coding practices, rather than having to pick it up the way I did.

Do you think there is a big difference in for...in and for loops? What kind of "for" do you prefer to use and why? Let's say we have an array of associative arrays:  So we can iterate:  And:  I don't see a big difference. Are there any performance issues?
I've been using  to wrap text in s and s. However, it doesn't seem to work in table cells. I have a table set to , with one row and two columns. Text in columns, although styled with the above , doesn't wrap. It causes the text to go past the bounds of the cell. This happens on Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. Here's what the source looks like:       "Long Content" is larger than the bounds of my page, but it doesn't break with the above HTML. I've tried the suggestions below of adding  and , but neither helped.
I am currently getting this error:  System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session.  while running this code:  Model #1 - This model sits in a database on our Dev Server.

Please ignore the red circles in Model #2: that is from another question I had which is now answered. Note:  I still need to put in an isDeleted check so I can soft delete it from DB1 if it has gone out of our client's inventory. All I want to do, with this particular code, is connect a company in DB1 with a client in DB2, get their product list from DB2 and INSERT it in DB1 if it is not already there.  First time through should be a full pull of inventory.  Each time it is run there after nothing should happen unless new inventory came in on the feed over night.  So the big question - how to I solve the transaction error I am getting?  Do I need to drop and recreate my context each time through the loops (does not make sense to me)?
I have a dialog with  for input. When I click the "yes" button on dialog, it will validate the input and then close the dialog. However, if the input is wrong, I want to remain in the same dialog. Every time no matter what the input is, the dialog should be automatically closed when I click on the "no" button. How can I disable this? By the way, I have used PositiveButton and NegativeButton for the button on dialog.
Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

I can't update the content in ViewPager. A question: What is the relationship and correct usage of methods instantiateItem() and getItem() in FragmentPagerAdapter class? I was using only getItem() to instantiate and return my fragments:  This worked well (but as said I can't change the content). So I found this: ViewPager PagerAdapter not updating the View Particulary one in which it's talked about method instantiateItem():  "My approach is to use the setTag() method for any instantiated view in the instantiateItem() method"  So now I want to implement instantiateItem() in order to do that. But I don't know what I have to return there (return is Object) and what is the relation with getItem(int position)? Currently I'm using getItem to instantiate the Fragment, is that wrong? But then do I have to put the fragments in instance variable, or not implement getItem() at all...? I just don't understand it. I tried reading the reference:   public abstract Fragment getItem (int position) Return the Fragment associated with a specified position. public Object instantiateItem (ViewGroup container, int position) Create the page for the given position.

I have a problem with a Java application running under Linux. When I launch the application, using the default maximum heap size (64 MB), I see using the tops application that 240 MB of virtual Memory are allocated to the application.  This creates some issues with some other software on the computer, which is relatively resource-limited. The reserved virtual memory will not be used anyway, as far as I understand, because once we reach the heap limit an  is thrown.  I ran the same application under windows and I see that the Virtual Memory size and the Heap size are similar. Is there anyway that I can configure the Virtual Memory in use for a Java process under Linux? Edit 1: The problem is not the Heap.  The problem is that if I set a Heap of 128 MB, for example, still Linux allocates 210 MB of Virtual Memory, which is not needed, ever.** Edit 2: Using  allows limiting the amount of virtual memory.  If the size set is below 204 MB, then the application won't run even though it doesn't need 204 MB, only 64 MB.  So I want to understand why Java requires so much virtual memory.  Can this be changed? Edit 3: There are several other applications running in the system, which is embedded. And the system does have a virtual memory limit (from comments, important detail).

I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a  value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer).  I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt() function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by restricting yourself to integer-only domain.  Maintaining a lookup table is impratical (since there are about 231.5 integers whose square is less than 263). Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:   Notes: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.  Update 2:  A new solution posted by A. Rex has proven to be even faster.  In a run over the first 1 billion integers, the solution only required 34% of the time that the original solution used.  While the John Carmack hack is a little better for small values of n, the benefit compared to this solution is pretty small. Here is the A. Rex solution, converted to Java:   Update:  I've tried the different solutions presented below.  After exhaustive testing, I found that adding  to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine. The John Carmack hack was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the Carmack hack for n < 410881. Newton's method was a good bit slower than .  This is probably because  uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles. A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than . Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.  The one suggestion which did show improvements was made by John D. Cook.  You can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9.  This means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares.  Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime. Working from John's suggestion, I investigated properties of the last n bits of a perfect square.  By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits.  This means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math.  Implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm).  Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical. Here is the code that I have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers).  For values of n less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm.  Notes:  According to John's tests, using  statements is faster in C++ than using a , but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between  and . I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or  statement, I would just say .  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower.  I'm not sure why.  This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

In this, this and this thread I tried to find an answer on how to set the margins on a single view. However, I was wondering if there isn't an easier way. I'll explain why I rather wouldn't want to use this approach: I have a custom Button which extends Button. If the background is set to something else than the default background (by calling either  or ), I want the margins to be 0. If I call this:  I want the margins to reset to -3dp (I already read here how to convert from pixels to dp, so once I know how to set margins in px, I can manage the conversion myself). But since this is called in the  class, the parent can vary from LinearLayout to TableLayout, and I'd rather not have him get his parent and check the instanceof that parent. That'll also be quite inperformant, I imagine. Also, when calling (using LayoutParams) , I don't know if this adds it to the correct position (haven't tried however), say the middle button of a row of five. Question: Is there any easier way to set the margin of a single Button programmatically besides using LayoutParams? EDIT: I know of the LayoutParams way, but I'd like a solution that avoids handling each different container type:  Because returns a , which do not have the attributes , , , . The mc instance you see is just a  which contains offset (-3dp) margins and (oml, omr, omt, omb) and the original margins (ml, mr, mt, mb).

After using PHP for a while now, I've noticed that not all PHP built in functions as fast as expected. Consider the below two possible implementations of a function that finds if a number is prime using a cached array of primes.  This is because in_array is implemented with a linear search O(n) which will linearly slow down as  grows. Where the  function is implemented with a hash lookup O(1) which will not slow down unless the hash table gets extremely populated (in which case it's only O(n)). So far I've had to discover the big-O's via trial and error, and occasionally looking at the source code. Now for the question... Is there was a list of the theoretical (or practical) big O times for all* the PHP built in functions? *or at least the interesting ones For example find it very hard to predict what the big O of functions listed because the possible implementation depends on unknown core data structures of PHP: array_merge, array_merge_recursive, array_reverse, array_intersect, array_combine, str_replace (with array inputs), etc.

One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.  Some constraints on the project:  The background could be very noisy. The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits). The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight). There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can! The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely "too much" on color detection). The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle. There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.  So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):  I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation: Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library. Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:  Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on "red" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.   Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise. Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.   Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:  You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here). It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor. It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will "learn". Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.  In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:  Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least... Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:  It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small. It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes) Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map. In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.  Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned? I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)

When should you use struct and not class in C#? My conceptual model is that structs are used in times when the item is merely a collection of value types.  A way to logically hold them all together into a cohesive whole. I came across these rules here:  A struct should represent a single value. A struct should have a memory footprint less than 16 bytes. A struct should not be changed after creation.  Do these rules work? What does a struct mean semantically?

What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the previous number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations. I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes. I know one method of doing this is to use the  method:  returns:  which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant:   returns:  Another method is to use the :  returns:  However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:  What is the best way to achieve this in Java?

Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient. I was doing a naive search — picking one sock and "iterating" the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n2/8 socks on average. As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution. Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could). So, the question is basically: Given a pile of  pairs of socks, containing  elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.) I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:  A general theoretical solution for a huge number of socks. The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?) Is it equivalent to the element distinctness problem?

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

I have a limited exposure to DB and have only used DB as an application programmer. I want to know about Clustered and Non clustered indexes.

Therefore table can have only   one clustered index. The leaf  nodes   of a clustered index contain the data   pages. A nonclustered index is a   special type of index in which  the   logical order of the index does not   match the physical  stored order of   the rows on disk. The leaf node of a    nonclustered index does not consist of   the data pages.  Instead, the leaf   nodes contain index rows.  What I found in SO was What are the differences between a clustered and a non-clustered index?. Can someone explain this in plain English?

MVC Framework: Capturing the output of a view  If I use this, I seem to be unable to do a redirectToAction, as it   tries to render a view that may not exist. If I do return the view, it   is completely messed up and doesn't look right at all.  Does anyone have any ideas/solutions to these issues i have, or have any suggestions for better ones? Many thanks! Below is an example. What I'm trying to do is create the GetViewForEmail method:  Accepted answer from Tim Scott (changed and formatted a little by me):  Example usage Assuming a call from the controller to get the order confirmation email, passing the Site.Master location.

I have installed an application, when I try to run it (it's an executable jar) nothing happens. When I run it from the commandline with:   java -jar "app.jar"  I get the following message:  no main manifest attribute, in "app.jar"  Normally, if I had created the program myself, I would have added a main class attribute to the manifest file. But in this case, since the file is from an application, i cannot do that. I also tried extracting the jar to see if I could find the main class, but there are to many classes and none of them has the word "main" in it's name. There must be a way to fix this because the program runs fine on other systems.
I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the  activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.  The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and . This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the  for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera. The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.  Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bit wise)?   This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with touch screen because of focus issue. (I can use roller ball.)  I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.  As soon as I disabled the image on the list view it worked fine again. FYI: This is how I was doing it:  Where  is a . Here is my LogCat:  I also have a new error when displaying an image:

Please see the parent table for more information: Current  Table  Should the parent table be like this so that I can easily access its status?

I'm updating our app to use the new M Permissions system. It is all working besides the onRequestPermissionsResult(). I need to check a permission on a button press, and if it is successful, send a text message.

I've debugged and set breakpoints in the onRequestPermissionsResult() method but it never goes into it. This method gets called first:  And then my callback looks like this:  Has anybody ran into a similar issue? Appreciate any help with this. Thanks

In Hidden Features of Java the top answer mentions Double Brace Initialization, with a very enticing syntax:  This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which "can use any [...] methods in the containing scope".   Main question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!) Second question: The new HashSet must be the "this" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?   Third question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code? Summary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).   On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.   Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a "this" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat. Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone! 7/2017: Baeldung has a good summary of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern. 12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:  That's for sure the way to go.  If you're stuck with an earlier version, take a look at Google Collections' ImmutableSet.

For now, I can see two solutions:  push everything to the usb-orign, and copy it to the NAS again (implies a lot of work due to new commits to nas-origin); add a new remote to "local" and delete the old one (I fear I'll break my history).

I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:  Q1: We have a bag containing numbers , , , …, . Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.  I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:  A1: Well, the sum of the numbers  is  (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For , the sum is . Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly . Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in  time and  space.  At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:  Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?  I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution. The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: "useful") programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer. The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.  Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?  This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a  time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the  time input scan) is defined in k not N. So the question here is simple:  How would you solve Q2? How would you solve Q3? How would you solve Qk?   Clarifications  Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100. I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using  bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N. I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).  So again, of course you must scan the input in , but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.   Without , the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.  Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.  With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.  My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.  What is going on? Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.

Problem: Fragment  in  is fired before the fragment becomes actually visible. For example, I have 2 fragments with  and . The second fragment is only available for authorized users and I need to ask the user to log in when the fragment becomes visible (using an alert dialog). BUT the  creates the second fragment when the first is visible in order to cache the second fragment and makes it visible when the user starts swiping. So the  event is fired in the second fragment long before it becomes visible. That's why I'm trying to find an event which fires when the second fragment becomes visible to show a dialog at the appropriate moment. How can this be done?

I have an android layout which has a  with a number of elements with in it. At the bottom of the  I have a  which is then populated by an adapter. The problem that I am experiencing, is that android is excluding the  from the  as the  already has a scroll-able function.  I want the  to be as long as the content is and for the master scroll view to be scroll-able. How can I achieve this behavior? Here is my main layout:  I then programmatically add my components to the linearlayour with the id: .  Below is one of the views that is loaded into that linearlayout. This is the one giving me trouble with the scrolls.  My adapter then fills up this list view. Here is an image from the android hierarchy viewer when I click on the master scrollView:  As you can see, it is excluding the reviews listView. I should be able to scroll the page down and see 8 reviews, but instead it only shows me those 3, and I can scroll on the tiny part where the reviews are. I want a global page scroll

I'm working on a projects which involves a lot of database writes, I'd say (70% inserts and 30% reads).  This ratio would also include updates which I consider to be one read and one write.  The reads can be dirty (e.g. I don't need 100% accurate information at the time of read). The task in question will be doing over 1 million database transactions an hour.   I've read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB, and MyISAM seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database/tables that I'll be using for this task.  From what I seem to be reading, InnoDB is good if transactions are needed since row level locking is supported. Does anybody have any experience with this type of load (or higher)?  Is MyISAM the way to go?

I've been experimenting with the new android build system and I've run into a small issue.  I've compiled my own aar package of ActionBarSherlock which I've called 'actionbarsherlock.aar'.  What I'm trying to do is actually use this aar to build my final APK.

But my problem is that I want to provide that dependency as a aar file package MANUALLY just if I would a JAR then I can't seem to figure out how to properly include it into my project.  I've attempted to use the compile configuration but this doesn't seem to work.  I keep on getting cannot find symbol during compile which tells me that the classes.jar from aar package isn't getting included in the classpath.

I am also building a custom directive where I would like to do something similar to this. However I can't find a way to watch an expression (and maybe that is impossible and the reason why it works like this). Here is a plnkr to show what I mean: http://plnkr.co/edit/iSh0t8swDEyGbh7ylZg2?p=preview
I am trying to support CORS in my Node.js application that uses the Express.js web framework. I have read a Google group discussion about how to handle this, and read a few articles about how CORS works. First, I did this (code is written in CoffeeScript syntax):  It doesn't seem to work. It seems like my browser (Chrome) is not sending the initial OPTIONS request. When I just updated the block for the resource I need to submit a cross-origin GET request to:  It works (in Chrome). This also works in Safari. I have read that...  In a browser implementing CORS, each cross-origin GET or POST request is preceded by an OPTIONS request that checks whether the GET or POST is OK.  So my main question is, how come this doesn't seem to happen in my case? Why isn't my app.options block called? Why do I need to set the headers in my main app.get block?
When verbally talking about methods, I'm never sure whether to use the word argument or parameter or something else. Either way the other people know what I mean, but what's correct, and what's the history of the terms? I'm a C# programmer, but I also wonder whether people use different terms in different languages. For the record I'm self-taught without a background in Computer Science. (Please don't tell me to read Code Complete because I'm asking this for the benefit of other people who don't already have a copy of Steve McConnell's marvellous book.) Summary The general consensus seems to be that it's OK to use these terms interchangeably in a team environment. Except perhaps when you're defining the precise terminology; then you can also use "formal argument/parameter" and "actual argument/parameter" to disambiguate.
What exactly is RESTful programming?
What does RESTful Authentication mean and how does it work?  I can't find a good overview on Google.  My only understanding is that you pass the session key (remeberal) in the URL, but this could be horribly wrong.

I have been running into issues with the chrome autofill behavior on several forms.  The fields in the form all have very common and accurate names, such as "email", "name", or "password", and they also have  set.  The autocomplete flag has successfully disabled the autocomplete behavior, where a dropdown of values appear as you start typing, but has not changed the values that Chrome auto-populates the fields as.  This behavior would be ok except that chrome is filling the inputs incorrectly, for example filling the phone input with an email address. Customers have complained about this, so it's verified to be happening in multiple cases, and not as some some sort of result to something that I've done locally on my machine.  The only current solution I can think of is to dynamically generate custom input names and then extract the values on the backend, but this seems like a pretty hacky way around this issue. Are there any tags or quirks that change the autofill behavior that could be used to fix this?

I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:   &  are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call // after fetching all the dependencies.  is like , but builds flattened dependencies trees (unlike  which do it recursively). Meaning  fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while  expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes  and  are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter on front-end).  and  are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).  vs.  (is like  vs.  or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster.   () - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers.  / + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use / over  + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. "on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp").  allows packaging node modules for browsers.  vs 's  is actually AMD vs CommonJS.  Questions:  What is  & ? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference? Where would you use ? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?  When would you use / over  + plugins? Please provide examples when you need to use a combination
I'm trying to put together a comprehensive regex to validate phone numbers. Ideally it would handle international formats, but it must handle US formats, including the following:  1-234-567-8901 1-234-567-8901 x1234 1-234-567-8901 ext1234 1 (234) 567-8901 1.234.567.8901 1/234/567/8901 12345678901  I'll answer with my current attempt, but I'm hoping somebody has something better and/or more elegant.

I have created the meat and guts of my application but I want to add a different activity that will be the starting point (sort of a log-in screen). Couple questions:  1 I have a fairly decent handle on how to switch between activities (based on this article: http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7498) but I'm not sure how to go about creating a new one (with eclipse). 2 Once I have a new activity created, how can I set it as the default activity of my application?  I presume I could just change the name of the classes...but is there a more elegant way to handle that (maybe within the )?
I want to trigger an ajax request when the user has finished typing in a text box. I don't want it to run the function on every time the user types a letter because that would result in A LOT of ajax requests, however I don't want them to have to hit the enter button either. Is there a way so I can detect when the user has finished typing and then do the ajax request? Using jQuery here! Dave

The Swift Programming Language guide has the following example:   Then when assigning the apartment to the person, they use an exclamation point to "unwrap the instance":  What does it mean to "unwrap the instance"? Why is it necessary? How is it different from just doing the following:  I'm very new to the Swift language.  Just trying to get the basics down.  UPDATE: The big piece of the puzzle that I was missing (not directly stated in the answers - at least not at the time of writing this) is that when you do the following:  that does NOT mean that " is of type  and it might be nil", as I originally thought. I was simply misunderstanding that  and  are completely separate types.  Once I grasped that, all of the other ,  madness, and the great answers below, made a lot more sense.

I once had the task of determining the following performance parameters from inside a running application:  Total virtual memory available Virtual memory currently used Virtual memory currently used by my process Total RAM available RAM currently used RAM currently used by my process % CPU currently used % CPU currently used by my process  The code had to run on Windows and Linux. Even though this seems to be a standard task, finding the necessary information in the manuals (WIN32 API, GNU docs) as well as on the Internet took me several days, because there's so much incomplete/incorrect/outdated information on this topic to be found out there. In order to save others from going through the same trouble, I thought it would be a good idea to collect all the scattered information plus what I found by trial and error here in one place.

Can I convert a string representing a boolean value (e.g., 'true', 'false') into a intrinsic type in JavaScript? I have a hidden form in HTML that is updated based upon a user's selection within a list. This form contains some fields which represent boolean values and are dynamically populated with an intrinsic boolean value. However, once this value is placed into the hidden input field it becomes a string. The only way I could find to determine the field's boolean value, once it was converted into a string, was to depend upon the literal value of its string representation.  Is there a better way to accomplish this?

This is a self Q&A of a handy piece of code I came up with. Currently, there isn't an easy way to embed an SVG image and then have access to the SVG elements via CSS. There are various methods of using JS SVG frameworks, but they are overly complicated if all you are doing is making a simple icon with a rollover state. So here is what I came up with, which I think is by far the easiest way to use SVG files on a website. It takes its concept from the early text-to-image replacement methods, but as far as I am aware has never been done for SVGs. This is the question: How do I embed an SVG and change its color in CSS without using a JS-SVG framework?

What is the correct way to draw isometric tiles in a 2D game? I've read references (such as this one) that suggest the tiles be rendered in a way that will zig-zag each column in the 2D array representation of the map. I imagine that they should be drawn more in a diamond fashion, where what gets drawn to the screen relates more closely to what the 2D array would look like, just rotated a little. Are there advantages or disadvantages to either method?

There are tons of errors this file encounters through bad links, poorly formed XML, missing entries, and other things I've yet to categorize. I initially made this program to handle errors like this:  But now I want to log errors:  Note this is printing to a log file for later review. This usually prints very useless data. What I want is to print the exact same lines printed when the error triggers without the try-except intercepting the exception, but I don't want it to halt my program since it is nested in a series of for loops that I would like to see to completion.

referencing the play-services via gradle stopped working for me - boiled it down - even the sample I used as a reference in the first place stopped working:  https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/posts/4Yhpn6p9icf  I fear that just the version increased but that raises 2 questions:   #1) what is the new one?  #2) why is the old version gone?
In SQL Server 2005 I have a table cm_production that lists all the code that's been put into production. The table has a ticket_number, program_type, and program_name and push_number along with some other columns.  GOAL: Count all the DISTINCT program names by program type and push number What I have so far is:  This gets me partway there, but it's counting all the program names, not the distinct ones (which I don't expect it to do in that query). I guess I just can't wrap my head around how to tell it to count only the distinct program names without selecting them. Or something.

I have an acute problem on my website. In Google Chrome some customers are not able to proceed to my payment page. When trying to submit a form I get this error:  This is from the JavaScript console.

I'm new at the branching complexities of Git. I always work on a single branch and commit changes and then periodically push to my remote origin. Somewhere recently, I did a reset of some files to get them out of commit staging, and later did a  to get rid of a couple recent local commits. Now I'm in a state I don't quite understand. In my working area,  shows exactly what I'd expect-- I'm on the right train with the commits I didn't want gone, and new ones there, etc. But I just pushed to the remote repository, and what's there is different-- a couple of the commits I'd killed in the rebase got pushed, and the new ones committed locally aren't there.  I think "master/origin" is detached from HEAD, but I'm not 100% clear on what that means, how to visualize it with the command line tools, and how to fix it.

I'm trying out Git on Windows. I got to the point of trying "git commit" and I got this error:  Terminal is dumb but no VISUAL nor   EDITOR defined. Please supply the   message using either -m or -F option.  So I figured out I need to have an environment variable called EDITOR. No problem. I set it to point to Notepad. That worked, almost.

This question has been asked before - but with no satisfying answer at all! So I'm trying it again. I want to give my application launcher icon (the one that is displayed on the startscreen!) a different, shorter caption. It seems the launcher takes its label from the mainfest section about the main activity's label, as here:   I already changed the original reference to my app's name @string/app_name to a different, shorter string resource here. BUT - big BUT: this also of course changes this activity's default title! And I did not want that to happen, there's enough space for a long application name! Setting the long title again in  using the  method does no good either, because the short name will be visible to the user for a short time, but long enough to notice! And - please don't answer my question by refering to a custom titlebar... I do not want to go that long way, just because of a stupid string title! It's a pain to draw a custom title bar for so little effect! Is there no easy way to just give the launcher a different string to display? Thanks for your answers! Edit: One more reason why having a custom titlebar is a pain is that it will not look like the default titlebar, I would have to explicitly do things to make it look alike on each device! And that can't be a solution if, after all, I don't want a different appearance!

I'm pretty much new in Python object oriented programming and I have trouble understanding the  function (new style classes) especially when it comes to multiple inheritance. For example if you have something like:  What I don't get is: will the  class inherit both constructor methods? If yes, then which one will be run with super() and why? And what if you want to run the other one? I know it has something to do with Python method resolution order (MRO).

Although elements like s normally grow to fit their contents, using the  property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: if floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse. For example:      The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have . How do you solve this problem? I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.  Solution 1 Float the parent.      Pros: Semantic code. Cons: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element? Solution 2 Give the parent an explicit height.      Pros: Semantic code. Cons: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break. Solution 3 Append a "spacer" element inside the parent element, like this:      Pros: Straightforward to code. Cons: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack. Solution 4 Set parent to .      Pros: Doesn't require extra div. Cons: Seems like a hack - that's not the  property's stated purpose. Comments? Other suggestions?

In iOS 7 the  has been designed in a way that it merges with the view like this:  (GUI designed by Tina Tavčar)  It is cool, but it will somewhat mess up your view when you have something at the top part of your view, and it becomes overlapped with the status bar. Is there a simple solution (such as setting a property in info.plist) that can change the way it works [not overlapping] back to how it is in iOS6?  I know a more straightforward solution is to have  + 20 points for every single view controller, but changing them will screw other dimensions up (having a different  can cause problem to custom segues, etc.) and suddenly it turns into a tedious job that is best to be avoided.  I'll really be glad if someone can provide me an one-liner solution for this.  P.S. I know I can hide the status bar by doing things like having  In  method, but that's a workaround, a shortcut avoiding the problem, so I don't consider that a real solution.

C and C++ have many differences, and not all valid C code is valid C++ code. (By "valid" I mean standard code with defined behavior, i.e. not implementation-specific/undefined/etc.) Is there any scenario in which a piece of code valid in both C and C++ would produce different behavior when compiled with a standard compiler in each language? To make it a reasonable/useful comparison (I'm trying to learn something practically useful, not to try to find obvious loopholes in the question), let's assume:  Nothing preprocessor-related (which means no hacks with , pragmas, etc.)   Anything implementation-defined is the same in both languages (e.g. numeric limits, etc.) We're comparing reasonably recent versions of each standard (e.g. say, C++98 and C90 or later) If the versions matter, then please mention which versions of each produce different behavior.

How can I reference the script element that loaded the javascript that is currently running? Here's the situation. I have a "master" script being loaded high in the page, first thing under the HEAD tag.  There is a script in "scripts.js" which needs to be able to do on-demand loading of other scripts.

However, is there any feasible way to keep the output files in the root of the project tree and use .gitignore to ignore everything except the files I'm tracking with Git? Something like

This question attempts to collect a community-maintained list of quality books on the C programming language, targeted at various skill levels. C is a complex programming language that is difficult to pick up on-the-go by reading online tutorials. A comprehensive book is often the best way to learn the language, and finding a good book is the first step. It is important to avoid badly-written books, and even more importantly, books that contain serious technical errors. Please suggest edits to the accepted answer to add quality books, with an approximate skill level and a short blurb/description about each book. (Note that the question is locked, so no new answers will be accepted. A single answer is being maintained with the list.) Feel free to debate book choices, quality, headings, summaries, skill levels, and anything else you see that is wrong. Books that are deemed satisfactory by the C community here will stick around on the list; the rest will be regularly removed. For books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU), a link to those reviews should be added along with the book.

Is there a simple way to delete all local branches which do not have a remote equivalent? Example: Branches (local and remote)  master origin/master origin/bug-fix-a origin/bug-fix-b origin/bug-fix-c  Locally, I only have a master branch. Now I need to work on bug-fix-a, so I check it out, work on it, and push changes to the remote. Next I do the same with bug-fix-b. Branches (local and remote)  master bug-fix-a bug-fix-b origin/master origin/bug-fix-a origin/bug-fix-b origin/bug-fix-c  Now I have local branches master, bug-fix-a, bug-fix-b. The Master branch maintainer will merge my changes into master and delete all branches he has already merged. So the current state is now: Branches (local and remote)  master bug-fix-a bug-fix-b origin/master origin/bug-fix-c  Now I would like to call some command to delete branches (in this case bug-fix-a, bug-fix-b), which are no longer represented in the remote repository. It would be something like the existing command , but more like .

I have a list with 15 numbers in, and I need to write some code that produces all 32,768 combinations of those numbers.  I've found some code (by Googling) that apparently does what I'm looking for, but I found the code fairly opaque and am wary of using it. Plus I have a feeling there must be a more elegant solution. The only thing that occurs to me would be to just loop through the decimal integers 1–32768 and convert those to binary, and use the binary representation as a filter to pick out the appropriate numbers.  Does anyone know of a better way? Using , maybe?

So, I started learning to code in Python and later Django. The first times it was hard looking at tracebacks and actually figure out what I did wrong and where the syntax error was. Some time has passed now and some way along the way, I guess I got a routine in debugging my Django code. As this was done early in my coding experience, I sat down and wondered if how I was doing this was ineffective and could be done faster. I usually manage to find and correct the bugs in my code, but I wonder if I should be doing it faster? I usually just use the debug info Django gives when enabled. When things do end up as I thought it would, I break the code flow a lot with a syntax error, and look at the variables at that point in the flow to figure out, where the code does something other than what I wanted. But can this be improved? Are there some good tools or better ways to debug your Django code?

Problem: Fragment  in  is fired before the fragment becomes actually visible. For example, I have 2 fragments with  and . The second fragment is only available for authorized users and I need to ask the user to log in when the fragment becomes visible (using an alert dialog). BUT the  creates the second fragment when the first is visible in order to cache the second fragment and makes it visible when the user starts swiping. So the  event is fired in the second fragment long before it becomes visible. That's why I'm trying to find an event which fires when the second fragment becomes visible to show a dialog at the appropriate moment. How can this be done?

I've tried changing the class of my  to a  but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.   Do I need both a UIView and a ?  Does one go inside the other? [EDIT: I now know that you want a  inside of a , and the trick is to programatically set the content size of the  to the frame size of the .] Then what needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field? Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder.  I'd like to only write code for what needs it. Note: the  (or ) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (), which needs to function as normal.  Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.   I've got it working where I change the frame size of the  when the keyboard goes up and down.  I'm simply using:   However this doesn't automatically "move up" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.

Is there a way to tell IntelliJ never to use wildcard imports? Under 'Settings > Code Style > Imports', I can see that you can specify the 'class count' prior to IntelliJ using wildcard imports.  However, if I never want to use wildcard imports can I turn this functionality off?   I have tried putting -1 or leaving the field blank but that just tells IntelliJ to always use wildcard imports.  Obviously a not-so-nice solution would be to put a ridiculously high number so that you never encounter wildcard imports but I was hoping there was a nicer way to just turn it off.

In the other one, I have to add the key every time I login.  As far as I remember, I did the same thing on both. The only difference is that the key was created on the one that is added permanently. Does anyone know how to add it permanently to the other machine as well?

Or is there another (perhaps more efficient) way to do all this?

I am processing a  of directories and files. A user can select either a file or a directory and then do something with it. This requires me to have a method which performs different actions based on the user's selection. At the moment I am doing something like this to determine whether the path is a file or a directory:  I cannot help to feel that there is a better way to do this! I was hoping to find a standard .NET method to handle this, but I haven't been able to do so. Does such a method exist, and if not, what is the most straightforward means to determine whether a path is a file or directory?

I find programming in PHP quite frustrating. Quite often I will try and run the script and just get a blank screen back. No error message, just empty screen. The cause might have been a simple syntax error (wrong bracket, missing semicolon), or a failed function call, or something else entirely. It is very difficult to figure out what went wrong. I end up commenting out code, entering "echo" statements everywhere, etc. trying to narrow down the problem. But there surely must be a better way, right?. So, is there a way to get PHP to produce useful error message like Java does? Can anyone recommend good PHP debugging tips, tools and techniques?
I'm looking for a way to completely remove the separator line in a UITableView when in the plain mode.

UPDATE If you're a Mac/OS X user I would HIGHLY recommend using Homebrew as your package installer/manager. You can find it HERE. Since originally asking this question I have removed all my prior installs of things like rmagick and imagemagick, and reinstalled them using Homebrew. Super easy with a huge catalog of packages, and updates/uninstalls are a cinch as well!
According to the paper written by Martin Fowler, inversion of control is the principle where the control flow of a program is inverted: instead of the programmer controlling the flow of a program, the external sources (framework, services, other components) take control of it. It's like we plug something into something else. He mentioned an example about EJB 2.0:  For example the Session Bean interface   defines ejbRemove, ejbPassivate   (stored to secondary storage), and   ejbActivate (restored from passive   state). You don't get to control when   these methods are called, just what   they do. The container calls us, we   don't call it.  This leads to the difference between framework and library:  Inversion of Control is a key part of   what makes a framework different to a   library. A library is essentially a   set of functions that you can call,   these days usually organized into   classes. Each call does some work and   returns control to the client.  I think, the point of view that DI is IOC, means the dependency of an object is inverted: instead it controls its own dependencies, life cycle... something else does it for you. But, as you told me about DI by hands, DI is not necessarily IOC. We can still have DI and no IOC. However, in this paper (from the pococapsule, another IOC Framework for C/C++), it suggests that because of IOC and DI, the IOC containers and DI frameworks are far more superior to J2EE, since J2EE mixes the framework code into the components, thus not making it Plain Old Java/C++ Object (POJO/POCO). Inversion of Control Containers other than the Dependency Injection pattern: http://www.pocomatic.com/docs/whitepapers/ioc-vs-di/ Additional reading to understand what's the problem with old Component-Based Development Framework, which leads to the second paper above: Why and what of Inversion of Control: http://www.pocomatic.com/docs/whitepapers/ioc/ My Question: What's exactly is IOC and DI? I am confused. Based on pococapsule, IOC is something more significant than just invert the control of objects or between programmers and frameworks.

What are the differences in implementing interfaces implicitly and explicitly in C#? When should you use implicit and when should you use explicit? Are there any pros and/or cons to one or the other?

I think this guideline is very valid in a pre-IoC-time, when you don't pass things around as interfaces. Could anyone touch on that aspect as well?

I am developing a piece of software in Python that will be distributed to my employer's customers. My employer wants to limit the usage of the software with a time restricted license file. If we distribute the .py files or even .pyc files it will be easy to (decompile and) remove the code that checks the license file. Another aspect is that my employer does not want the code to be read by our customers, fearing that the code may be stolen or at least the "novel ideas". Is there a good way to handle this problem? Preferably with an off-the-shelf solution. The software will run on Linux systems (so I don't think py2exe will do the trick).

I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons. One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about "big data" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive. My first thought is to use  to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this: What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:  Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas  Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on "large data". Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:  Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory. In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory. I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns. I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.  I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem. Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:  I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns. Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, .  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset. Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model. A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case. It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations. The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.  It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).
I am calling a function like the one below by click on divs with a certain class.

I find programming in PHP quite frustrating. Quite often I will try and run the script and just get a blank screen back. No error message, just empty screen. The cause might have been a simple syntax error (wrong bracket, missing semicolon), or a failed function call, or something else entirely. It is very difficult to figure out what went wrong. I end up commenting out code, entering "echo" statements everywhere, etc. trying to narrow down the problem. But there surely must be a better way, right?. So, is there a way to get PHP to produce useful error message like Java does? Can anyone recommend good PHP debugging tips, tools and techniques?

Why would you create a "Implicitly Unwrapped Optional" vs creating just a regular variable or constant?

At this point, the cached data will be associated with , and I would like to clean it up. How can I reset the Redux store to its initial state when the first user logs out?

I'm looking for a best way to implement common Windows keyboard shortcuts (for example Ctrl+F, Ctrl+N) in my Windows Forms application in C#. The application has a main form which hosts many child forms (one at a time). When a user hits Ctrl+F, I'd like to show a custom search form. The search form would depend on the current open child form in the application. I was thinking of using something like this in the ChildForm_KeyDown event:  But this doesn't work. The event doesn't even fire when you press a key. What is the solution?

Ok, I'm now banging my head against a brick wall with this one. I have an HTML (not XHTML) document that renders fine in Firefox 3 and IE 7.  It uses fairly basic CSS to style it and renders fine in HTML. I'm now after a way of converting it to PDF.  I have tried:  DOMPDF: it had huge problems with tables.  I factored out my large nested tables and it helped (before it was just consuming up to 128M of memory then dying--thats my limit on memory in php.ini) but it makes a complete mess of tables and doesn't seem to get images.  The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points; HTML2PDF and HTML2PS: I actually had better luck with this.  It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and Htmldoc: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.  I tried a Windows app called Html2Pdf Pilot that actually did a pretty decent job but I need something that at a minimum runs on Linux and ideally runs on-demand via PHP on the Webserver. I really can't believe I'm this stuck.  Am I missing something?

C and C++ have many differences, and not all valid C code is valid C++ code. (By "valid" I mean standard code with defined behavior, i.e. not implementation-specific/undefined/etc.) Is there any scenario in which a piece of code valid in both C and C++ would produce different behavior when compiled with a standard compiler in each language? To make it a reasonable/useful comparison (I'm trying to learn something practically useful, not to try to find obvious loopholes in the question), let's assume:  Nothing preprocessor-related (which means no hacks with , pragmas, etc.)   Anything implementation-defined is the same in both languages (e.g. numeric limits, etc.) We're comparing reasonably recent versions of each standard (e.g. say, C++98 and C90 or later) If the versions matter, then please mention which versions of each produce different behavior.
What's all this fuss about Python and CPython (Jython,IronPython), I don't get it: python.org mentions that CPython is:  The "traditional" implementation of Python (nicknamed CPython)  yet another Stack Overflow question mentions that:  CPython is the default byte-code interpreter of Python, which is written in C.  Honestly I don't get what both of those explanations practically mean but what I thought was that, if I use CPython does that mean when I run a sample python code, it compiles it to C language and then executes it as if it were C code So what exactly is CPython and how does it differ when compared with python and should I probably use CPython over Python and if so what are its advantages?

I have a javascript app that sends ajax POST requests to a certain URL. Response might be a JSON string or it might be a file (as an attachment). I can easily detect Content-Type and Content-Disposition in my ajax call, but once I detect that the response contains a file, how do I offer the client to download it? I've read a number of similar threads here but none of them provide the answer I'm looking for.  Please, please, please do not post answers suggesting that I shouldn't use ajax for this or that I should redirect the browser, because none of this is an option. Using a plain HTML form is also not an option. What I do need is to show a download dialog to the client. Can this be done and how? EDIT: Apparently, this cannot be done, but there is a simple workaround, as suggested by the accepted answer. For anyone who comes across this issue in the future, here's how I solved it:  So basically, just generate a HTML form with the same params that were used in AJAX request and submit it.

Assume you have a flat table that stores an ordered tree hierarchy:  Here's a diagram, where we have .  Root node 0 is fictional.                         [0] ROOT                           /    \                [1] Node 1          [3] Node 2               /       \                   \     [2] Node 1.1     [6] Node 1.2      [5] Node 2.1           /            [4] Node 1.1.1  What minimalistic approach would you use to output that to HTML (or text, for that matter) as a correctly ordered, correctly indented tree?  Assume further you only have basic data structures (arrays and hashmaps), no fancy objects with parent/children references, no ORM, no framework, just your two hands. The table is represented as a result set, which can be accessed randomly.  Pseudo code or plain English is okay, this is purely a conceptional question. Bonus question: Is there a fundamentally better way to store a tree structure like this in a RDBMS?  EDITS AND ADDITIONS To answer one commenter's (Mark Bessey's) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express "these are top level". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted. The "result set" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay. The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a "millions of entries" tree in mind, though. Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable. I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.

I was wondering someone knew of a generic SQL way of doing such a thing with SQLite.

In Git, is there a way to merge all changes from one branch into another, but squash to a single commit at the same time?   I often work on a new feature in a separate branch and will regularly commit/push - mainly for backup or to transfer what I'm working on to another machine.  Mostly those commits say "Feature xxx WIP" or something redundant. Once that work is finished and I want to merge WIP branch back into master, I'd like to discard all those intermediate commits, and just a have a single clean commit. Is there an easy way to do this?  Alternatively, how about a command that squashes all commits on a branch since the point where it was branched?

Should I switch my editor to insert spaces instead of tabs right away or keep on going like I used to?

I'm going to start with some basics, so I will write simple programs that create files, directories, edit XML files and so on, nothing too complex for now. I guess Java SE (Standard Edition) is the one I should install on my Windows 7 desktop. I already have Komodo IDE which I will use to write the Java code.

If I have an array in Swift, and try to access an index that is out of bounds, there is an unsurprising runtime error:  However, I would have thought with all the optional chaining and safety that Swift brings, it would be trivial to do something like:  Instead of:  But this is not the case - I have to use the ol'  statement to check and ensure the index is less than . I tried adding my own  implementation, but I'm not sure how to pass the call to the original implementation, or to access the items (index-based) without using subscript notation:

I guess most of you, developers, use any VCS, and I hope some of you use Git. Do you have any tip or trick how to get a download URL for a single file in a repository? I don't want the URL for displaying the raw file; in case of binaries it's for nothing. http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/41-download-single-file Is it even possible to use GitHub as a "download server"? If we decide to switch to Google Code, is the mentioned functionality presented here? Or is there any free-of-charge hosting and VCS for open-source projects?
I like to be sure that everything will work just by copying the contents of the Java folder and setting the environment variables. I usually run the installer in a virtual machine, zip the \java folder contents, go back to a snapshot of the virtual machine, and then unzip the compressed file. I couldn't find a place where the latest JRE / JDK is available as a zip file... http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp http://download.java.net/jdk6/ Alternately, is it safe to assume that exe installer from sun just will just unzip the whole thing, without messing around with the registry, environment variables, etc...?

I thought they could be, but as I'm not putting my money where my mouth was (so to speak) setting the readonly attribute doesn't actually seem to do anything.

I am trying to support CORS in my Node.js application that uses the Express.js web framework. I have read a Google group discussion about how to handle this, and read a few articles about how CORS works. First, I did this (code is written in CoffeeScript syntax):  It doesn't seem to work. It seems like my browser (Chrome) is not sending the initial OPTIONS request. When I just updated the block for the resource I need to submit a cross-origin GET request to:  It works (in Chrome). This also works in Safari. I have read that...  In a browser implementing CORS, each cross-origin GET or POST request is preceded by an OPTIONS request that checks whether the GET or POST is OK.  So my main question is, how come this doesn't seem to happen in my case? Why isn't my app.options block called? Why do I need to set the headers in my main app.get block?

I have a string which contains a mixture of upper and lower case characters, for example "a Simple string" . What I want to do is to convert first character of each word ( I can assume that words are separated by spaces) into upper case. So I want the result as "A Simple String". Is there any easy way to do this? I don't want to split the string and do the conversion (that will be my last resort). Also, it is guaranteed that the strings are in English.

I have a Date object in Java stored as Java's Date type. I also have a Gregorian Calendar created date. The gregorian calendar date has no parameters and therefore is an instance of today's date (and time?). With the java date, I want to be able to get the year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds from the java date type and compare the the gregoriancalendar date. I saw that at the moment the Java date is stored as a long and the only methods available seem to just write the long as a formatted date string. Is there a way to access Year, month, day, etc? I saw that the , , etc. methods for  class have been deprecated. I was wondering what's the best practice to use the Java Date instance I have with the  date. My end goal is to do a date calculation so that I can check that the Java date is within so many hours, minutes etc of today's date and time. I'm still a newbie to Java and am getting a bit puzzled by this.

What I wanted to do is to remove the text from the 'Back' button of a , leaving only the blue chevron on the navigation bar. Keep in mind that I'm developing for iOS 7. I've tried several methods, including, but not limited to: This is the image method which I did not like (the image looked out of place):  Another method I tried was this, which simply did not work (nothing was displayed):  What I wanted to achieve is something like the back buttons found in the iOS 7 Music app, which only featured a single chevron.  Thanks.
The very common directory structure for even a simple Python module seems to be to separate the unit tests into their own  directory:  for example see this Python project howto. My question is simply What's the usual way of actually running the tests? I suspect this is obvious to everyone except me, but you can't just run  from the test directory as its  will fail as the module is not on the path. I know I could modify PYTHONPATH and other search path related tricks, but I can't believe that's the simplest way - it's fine if you're the developer but not realistic to expect your users to use if they just want to check the tests are passing. The other alternative is just to copy the test file into the other directory, but it seems a bit dumb and misses the point of having them in a separate directory to start with. So, if you had just downloaded the source to my new project how would you run the unit tests? I'd prefer an answer that would let me say to my users: "To run the unit tests do X."
I have an app that supports iOS8 and later, built in Xcode 7 and I am using a XIB for a Launch Screen (I do not have launch images). The view contains a single UILabel with the app version, and 2 UIImageViews with images that are both present in Images.xcassets: A logo and a splash image. The UILabel and the logo image appear correctly when I launch the application, but the splash image does not if I run the app on an iPad Air 2 with iOS9. I have tested on an Air and a Mini running iOS8, and iOS9 simulators for iPad 2, iPad Air, and iPad Air 2 and the image appears correctly in all of those. I ran some basic troubleshooting to see if I could figure out what is going on but I haven't been able to solve it and the only difference I can see between the image that's working and the one that's failing is when I added it to the assets... Here's a rundown of what I know:  The UIImageView for the splash image is in the correct place, at the correct size. I can tell this because I set its background color to green just to make sure. The view is there, but the image does not appear. So I'm assuming that the view is not to blame. Setting the UIImageView for the splash image to also use the logo image makes the logo image appear in the correct place for the view. This also leads me to assume that the view is not to blame. The UIImage that I am using in the splash image view is used elsewhere in the app and appears fine in those other views (the logo image is also used elsewhere in the app and appears fine). So I'm assuming that the image is valid and having it appear in other views is not a problem. I've confirmed that the settings of the UIImages for the logo and splash in the xcassets file are the same. They are set to Universal, Any width and height, multiple scale factors, rendered as default. There is one difference - the logo has 1x, 2x and 3x scales while the splash image only has 1x and 2x, but I have also tried using UIImages with only 1x, and 1x and 2x values in the UIView and they work (if they were added to the project some time ago). Adding another image of a different size or format (PNG and JPG) to my xcassets and using that UIImage in the UIImageView for the splash image also fails to display. Adding another UIImageView to the XIB file and allocating it a UIImage that was already in the xcassets works, the image appears in the loading screen. Copying and renaming the image files used for the logo and adding them to the project then using that UIImage in the splash view also fails to display. I have tried cleaning the project, restarting the development machine, and deleting the app from the Air 2 and reinstalling it just in case that was a problem.  These last three steps lead me to believe that there's some issue with images added after a certain point in the project file's lifetime. While I updated to Xcode 7 yesterday, the splash image was originally added in Xcode 6, but the logo image (also added in Xcode 6) was added some months before. I've looked over the json files for the logo image and splash image and they appear to have the same format. I've also trawled through the pbxproj file looking for differences and I can't see any. So I was wondering if anyone had any idea why the launch screen might not display these new images I'm adding on the Air 2 specifically? Other questions I've been reading through relating to images not appearing all seem to relate either to Launch Images, or to images in XIB files that have associated classes, neither of which seems relevant here.
I've tried every package I could possibly find and none of them will install in my project.  I've installed every update listed in the Extensions and Updates list that were available.  When I attempt to install SendGrid for example, this is the result (as is the result with all other packages):    I can't be the only one on the planet having issue with Visual Studio 2015 and the new and "improved" NuGet Package Manager.   UPDATE: Well, must be something odd in my solution because I created a new project from the VS2015 template (web) and the packages install just fine.  When I find out the issue, I'll post the resolution in the event others run into the same problem.   UPDATE 2: Ok, it's not our solution.  We created a new solution from scratch again (this has wasted a lot of our development time might I add), added a couple of packages (Identity, EF, SendGrid) and after checking the solution in to VSO, another developer performs a fresh creation of the branch and build errors occur.  When I go to the NuGet packages for an individual project, it acts as though none of the packages I have added are available.  Anyone else experiencing this?

What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the previous number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations. I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes. I know one method of doing this is to use the  method:  returns:  which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant:   returns:  Another method is to use the :  returns:  However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:  What is the best way to achieve this in Java?

Should I test the abstract class by extending it, stubbing out the abstract methods, and then test all the concrete methods?

Should I have an abstract test case that can be used to test the methods of the abstract class, and extend this class in my test case for objects that extend the abstract class? Note that my abstract class has some concrete methods.
I'm sure this must have been mentioned/asked before but have been searching for an age with no luck, my terminology must be wrong! I vaguely remember a tweet I saw a while ago that suggested there was a css rule available that would remove any styles previously set in the stylesheet for a particular element. A good use example might be in a mobile-first RWD site where much of the styling used for a particular element in the small-screen views needs 'resetting' or removing for the same element in the desktop view. A css rule that could achieve something like:  Eaxmple usage:  So we could quickly remove or re-set styling without having to declare every property. Make sense?

There are many blogs and discussions about websocket and HTTP, and many developers and sites strongly advocate websockets, but i still can not understand why. for example (arguments of websocket lovers):   HTML5 Web Sockets represents the next evolution of web communications—a full-duplex, bidirectional communications channel that operates through a single socket over the Web.     ( http://www.websocket.org/quantum.html )   HTTP supports streaming: request body streaming(you are using it while uploading large files) and response body streaming.   During making connection with WebSocket, client and server exchange data per frame which is 2 bytes each, compared to 8 kilo bytes of http header when you do continuous polling.   Why does that 2 bytes not include tcp and under tcp protocols overhead?  This is ~48 bytes http header. http chunked encoding - http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding :   So, the overhead per each chunk is not big.  Also both protocol works over TCP, so all TCP issues with long-live connections are still there. Question:  Why is websockets protocol better? Why was it implemented instead of updating http protocol?

The short: is there a way to have a git repo push to and pull from a list of remote repos (rather than a single "origin")? The long: I often have a situation when I'm developing an app in multiple computers, with different connectivity -- say a laptop while on transit, a computer "A" while I'm in a certain location, and another computer "B" while on another. Also, the laptop might have connectivity with only either "A" or "B", and sometimes both. What I would like to is for git to always "pull" from and "push" to all the computers it can currently connect to, so it's easier to jump from one machine to the other and continue working seamlessly.

Possible Duplicate: GROUP BY / aggregate function confusion in SQL   I got an error -  Column 'Employee.EmpID' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.   This situation fits into the answer given by Bill Karwin. correction for above, fits into answer by ExactaBox -    ORIGINAL QUESTION - For the SQL query -  I don't understand why I get this error. All I want to do is join the tables and then group all the employees in a particular location together.  I think I have a partial explanation for my own question. Tell me if its ok -  To group all employees that work in the same location we have to first mention the LocationID.  Then, we cannot/do not mention each employee ID next to it. Rather, we mention the total number of employees in that location, ie we should SUM() the employees working in that location. Why do we do it the latter way, i am not sure.  So, this explains the "it is not contained in either an aggregate function" part of the error. What is the explanation for the "GROUP BY clause" part of the error ?

I am trying to get the difference between the current date as  and a date from a PHP  call for example: . How do I go about getting the difference in time between the two dates. I'd like to have a function that compares the two dates and  then it returns minutes,  return hours and  return days and so on.  How should I go about this? EDIT: The current accepted answer has done exactly what I've wanted to do. I recommend it for easy usage for getting the time between two dates in the form that that PHP  function uses. If you aren't particularly familiar with PHP, that's the time in seconds from January 1st, 1970. This is beneficial for a backend in PHP. If perhaps you're using a backend like NodeJS you might want to consider some of the other options you'll find below.

I'm looking for guidance on good practices when it comes to return errors from a REST API. I'm working on a new API so I can take it any direction right now. My content type is XML at the moment, but I plan to support JSON in future. I am now adding some error cases, like for instance a client attempts to add a new resource but has exceeded his storage quota. I am already handling certain error cases with HTTP status codes (401 for authentication, 403 for authorization and 404 for plain bad request URIs). I looked over the blessed HTTP error codes but none of the 400-417 range seems right to report application specific errors. So at first I was tempted to return my application error with 200 OK and a specific XML payload (ie. Pay us more and you'll get the storage you need!) but I stopped to think about it and it seems to soapy (/shrug in horror). Besides it feels like I'm splitting the error responses into distinct cases, as some are http status code driven and other are content driven. So what is the industry recommendations? Good practices (please explain why!) and also, from a client pov, what kind of error handling in the REST API makes life easier for the client code?

I've run into a couple of cases now where it would be convenient to be able to find the "topmost" view controller (the one responsible for the current view), but haven't found a way to do it. Basically the challenge is this: Given that one is executing in a class that is not a view controller (or a view) [and does not have the address of an active view] and has not been passed the address of the topmost view controller (or, say, the address of the navigation controller), is it possible to find that view controller?  (And, if so, how?) Or, failing that, is it possible to find the topmost view?
I was just wondering how I could automatically increment the build (and version?) of my files using Visual Studio (2005).  If I look up the properties of say , the Version tab gives "File version: 5.1.2600.2180". I would like to get these cool numbers in the version of my dll's too, not version 1.0.0.0, which let's face it is a bit dull. I tried a few things, but it doesn't seem to be out-of-box functionality, or maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place (as usual). I work with mainly web projects.... I looked at both:  http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Auto_Increment_Version.aspx http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/build_versioning.aspx  and I couldn't believe it so much effort to do something is standard practice. EDIT: It does not work in VS2005 as far I can tell (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/AutoIncrementVersion.aspx)

Is there an easy way to find out the size of that object programmatically?  Is there a reference that defines how large primitive types and object references are for a ? Right now, I have code that says read up to 32,000 rows, but I'd also like to have code that says read as many rows as possible until I've used 32MB of memory.

Coming from Perl, I sure am missing the "here-document" means of creating a multi-line string in source code:  In Java I have to have cumbersome quotes and plus signs on every line as I concatenate my multiline string from scratch. What are some better alternatives?  Define my string in a properties file? Edit: Two answers say StringBuilder.append() is preferable to the plus notation.  Could anyone elaborate as to why they think so?  It doesn't look more preferable to me at all.  I'm looking for away around the fact that multiline strings are not a first-class language construct, which means I definitely don't want to replace a first-class language construct (string concatenation with plus) with method calls. Edit: To clarify my question further, I'm not concerned about performance at all.  I'm concerned about maintainability and design issues.

I'm studying the content of this preinst file that the script executes before that package is unpacked from its Debian archive (.deb) file. The script has the following code:  My first query is about the line:  I think that the rest of the script is pretty simple: It checks whether the Debian/Ubuntu package manager is executing an install operation. If it is, it checks whether my application has just been installed on the system. If it has, the script prints the message "MyApplicationName is just installed" and ends ( mean that ends with an “error”, doesn’t it?). If the user is asking the Debian/Ubuntu package system to install my package, the script also deletes two directories. Is this right or am I missing something?

If you need some additional info - don't hesitate asking. Every answer is highly appreciated and answered immidiately. Thank you. P.S. I guess this should be some kind of directive or a custom filter. Data itself SHOULD NOT be changed, only the output.
In Objective-C instance data can be ,  or . For example:  I haven't found any mention of access modifiers in the Swift reference. Is it possible to limit the visibility of data in Swift?
I want to add one day to a particular date. How can I do that?  Now I want to add one day to this date.
Without getting into a religious argument about why one is better than the other, what are the practical differences between Emacs and Vim? I'm looking to learn one or the other, but I realize the learning curve for each is high and I can't decide. I have never used an editor of this type (I've always used IDEs), so anything that helps a newbie is a plus.  Before a flame war starts: I'm not asking which is better, I'm asking the differences between the two. I would like an objective comparison. Thank you.
I have a directory structure like this:  Inside main and tools, and any other directory, at any level, there can be a 'bin' directory, which I want to ignore (and I want to ignore everything under it too). I've tried each of these patterns in .gitignore but none of them work:  Can anyone help me out? The first pattern (the one I think should be working) works just fine if I do this:  But I don't want to have an entry for every top-level directory and I don't want to have to modify .gitignore every time I add a new one. This is on Windows using the latest msysgit. EDIT: one more thing, there are files and directories that have the substring 'bin' in their names, I don't want those to be ignored :)

I have WampServer 2 installed on my Windows 7 computer. I'm using Apache 2.2.11 and PHP 5.2.11. When I attempt to upload any file from a form, it seems to upload, but in PHP, the  array is empty. There is no file in the  folder. I have configured  to allow file uploads and such. The  folder has read/write privileges for the current user. I'm stumped. HTML:  PHP:
I have a page that allows the user to download a dynamically-generated file. It takes a long time to generate, so I'd like to show a "waiting" indicator. The problem is, I can't figure out how to detect when the browser has received the file, so I can hide the indicator. I'm making the request in a hidden form, which POSTs to the server, and targets a hidden iframe for its results. This is so I don't replace the entire browser window with the result. I listen for a "load" event on the iframe, in the hope that it will fire when the download is complete. I return a "Content-Disposition: attachment" header with the file, which causes the browser to show the "Save" dialog. But the browser doesn't fire a "load" event in the iframe. One approach I tried is using a multi-part response. So it would send an empty HTML file, as well as the attached downloadable file. For example:  This works in Firefox; it receives the empty HTML file, fires the "load" event, then shows the "Save" dialog for the downloadable file. But it fails on IE and Safari; IE fires the "load" event but doesn't download the file, and Safari downloads the file (with the wrong name and content-type), and doesn't fire the "load" event. A different approach might be to make a call to start the file creation, then poll the server until it's ready, then download the already-created file. But I'd rather avoid creating temporary files on the server. Does anyone have a better idea?

I have a small utility that I use to download a MP3 from a website on a schedule and then builds/updates a podcast XML file which I've obviously added to iTunes. The text processing that creates/updates the XML file is written in Python. I use wget inside a Windows  file to download the actual MP3 however. I would prefer to have the entire utility written in Python though. I struggled though to find a way to actually down load the file in Python, thus why I resorted to . So, how do I download the file using Python?

I've had a bug in our software that occurs when I receive a connection timeout. These errors are very rare (usually when my connection gets dropped by our internal network). How can I generate this kind of effect artificially so I can test our software?  If it matters the app is written in C++/MFC using CAsyncSocket classes. Edit: I've tried using a non-existent host, and I get the socket error:  WSAEINVAL (10022) Invalid argument  My next attempt was to use Alexander's suggestion of connecting to a different port, e.g. 81 (on my own server though). That worked great. Exactly the same as a dropped connection (60 second wait, then error). Thank you!
I'm migrating a piece of code to make use of generics. One argument for doing so is that the for loop is much cleaner than keeping track of indexes, or using an explicit iterator. In about half the cases, the list (an ArrayList) is being iterated in reverse order by using an index today. Can someone suggest a cleaner way of doing this (since I dislike the  when working with collections), though it does work?  Note: I can't add any new dependencies outside the JDK.

I have read multiple posts on StackOverFlow about checked vs unchecked exceptions. I'm honestly still not quite sure how to use them properly.  Joshua Bloch in "Effective Java" said that   Use checked exceptions for   recoverable conditions and runtime   exceptions for programming errors   (Item 58 in 2nd edition)  Let's see if I understand this correctly. Here is my understanding of a checked exception:  1. Is the above consider a checked exception? 2. Is RuntimeException an unchecked exception? Here is my understanding of an unchecked exception:  4. Now, couldnt the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to recover the situation like this? Can I? (Note: my 3rd question is inside the  above)  5. Why do people do this?  Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner better? Why bubble up?  EDIT: Should I bubble up the exact exception or mask it using Exception? Below are my readings In Java, when should I create a checked exception, and when should it be a runtime exception? When to choose checked and unchecked exceptions

I've been somewhat 'putting up' with Github always asking for my username and password when I clone a repository.  I want to bypass this step because it is an annoyance within my workflow.  I tried setting up an SSH key (which I successfully did) using this guide. https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys and I was successful.   My problem is that I am still asked for my github password and passphrase when cloning a repository (using SSH).  My understanding was that after I set up this SSH key, I would no longer have to do that. I am a little unsure what to ask, so I will just state my goal.    I want to be able to clone repositories without having to put in my Github information all the time.  What am I missing with my SSH key? If anyone can provide some guidance or resources I would appreciate it, because I've always felt a little lost when it came to SSH authentication in GitHub. From my knowledge, this is a command that tests if things are working properly, here are the output from my console:  When I input my password, should that fail first? Then, when I enter my passphrase, it passes.

The JSON format natively doesn't support binary data. The binary data has to be escaped so that it can be placed into a string element (i.e. zero or more Unicode chars in double quotes using backslash escapes) in JSON. An obvious method to escape binary data is to use Base64. However, Base64 has a high processing overhead. Also it expands 3 bytes into 4 characters which leads to an increased data size by around 33%. One use case for this is the v0.8 draft of the CDMI cloud storage API specification. You create data objects via a REST-Webservice using JSON, e.g.  Are there better ways and standard methods to encode binary data into JSON strings?
What do the icons in the Eclipse debugger mean? What do the icon decorators in Eclipse mean? What do the icons in Eclipse's Package Explorer mean?

I just came to SO looking for this, didn't find it, and found it on my own elsewhere. But I thought it would be good for SO to have the answer for future reference; I wondered about them all the time when I was new to Eclipse (this was before I discovered SO).
I have recently been studying UML and drawing simple diagrams with ordinary plain arrows between classes, but I know it's not enough.

In C# 4.0, we have  in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. What is the true difference between  and . I did some sample program(help taken from MSDN)  for my own sake of learning with   but have many doubts as the idea is not so clear.  I have initially searched in Stackoverflow for a similar type of question but may be with this question title I was not able to get the same. If anyone knows about the same type of question being posted here earlier, kindly give the reference of the link.

Is it limited to classes that extend Context or only activities?  Is it usable for ListView items etc.?
How could I merge / convert multiple PDF files into one large PDF file?

I'm new to REST and I've observed that in some RESTful services they use different resource URI for update/get/delete and Create. Such as  Create - using /resources with POST method (observe plural) at some places using /resource (singular) Update - using /resource/123 with PUT method Get - Using /resource/123 with GET method  I'm little bit confused about this URI naming convention. What should we use plural or singular for resource creation? What should be the criteria while deciding that?
I have an app that has a text field on the lower half of the view. This means that when I go to type in the text field the keyboard covers the textfield. How would I go about moving the view upwards while typing so I can see what i'm typing and then moving it back down to its original place when the keyboard disappears? I've looked everywhere but all the solutions appear to be in Obj-C which I can't quite convert just yet. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I'm trying to learn how to use . The documentation is a little hard to understand and the tutorials that I found were either in Objective C or long complicated projects.

The answer below is my attempt to learn to do this.
I have a colleague who insists that his code doesn't need comments, it's "self documenting." I've reviewed his code, and while it's clearer than code which I've seen others produce, I still disagree that self-documenting code is as complete and useful as well commented and documented code. Help me understand his point of view.  What is self documenting code Can it really replace well commented and documented code Are there situations where it's better than well documented and commented code Are there examples where code cannot possibly be self-documenting without comments  Maybe it's just my own limitations, but I don't see how it can be a good practice. This is not meant to be an argument - please don't bring up reasons why well commented and documented code is high priority - there are many resources showing this, but they aren't convincing to my peer.  I believe I need to more fully understand his perspective to convince him otherwise.  Start a new question if you must, but don't argue here. Wow, quick response!  Please read all the existing answers and provide comments to answers rather than add new answers, unless your answer really is substantially different from every other answer in here. Also, those of you who are arguing against self documenting code -this is primarily to help me  understand the perspective (ie, positive aspects) of self-documenting code evangelists.  I expect others will downvote you if you don't stay on topic.

From time to time in Python, I see the block:  What is the reason for the try-except-else to exist? I do not like that kind of programming, as it is using exceptions to perform flow control. However, if it is included in the language, there must be a good reason for it, isn't it? It is my understanding that exceptions are not errors, and that they should only be used for exceptional conditions (e.g. I try to write a file into disk and there is no more space, or maybe I do not have permission), and not for flow control.  Normally I handle exceptions as:  Or if I really do not want to return anything if an exception happens, then:

Does the .NET String.Format method allow placement of a string at a fixed position within a fixed length string.  "           String Goes Here" "     String Goes Here      " "String Goes Here           "  How is this done using .NET? Edit - I have tried Format/PadLeft/PadRight to death.  They do not work.  I don't know why. I ended up writing my own function to do this. Edit - I made a mistake and used a colon instead of a comma in the format specifier.  Should be "{0,20}". Thanks for all of the excellent and correct answers.
What is the best way to go about calling a function given a string with the function's name in a Python program.  For example, let's say that I have a module , and I have a string whose contents are . What is the best way to go about calling ? I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don't just use . I figured out how to do it by using  to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I'm hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.

I happened to find myself having a basic filtering need: I have a list and I have to filter it by an attribute of the items. My code looked like this:  But then I thought, wouldn't it be better to write it like this?  It's more readable, and if needed for performance the lambda could be taken out to gain something.   Question is: are there any caveats in using the second way? Any performance difference? Am I missing the Pythonic Way™ entirely and should do it in yet another way (such as using itemgetter instead of the lambda)?
I'm doing some maintenance work on a database application and I've discovered that, joy of joys, even though values from one table are being used in the style of foreign keys, there's no foreign key constraints on the tables. I'm trying to add FK constraints on these columns, but I'm finding that, because there's already a whole load of bad data in the tables from previous errors which have been naively corrected, I need to find the rows which don't match up to the other table and then delete them. I've found some examples of this kind of query on the web, but they all seem to provide examples rather than explanations, and I don't understand why they work. Can someone explain to me how to construct a query which returns all the rows with no matches in another table, and what it's doing, so that I can make these queries myself, rather than coming running to SO for every table in this mess that has no FK constraints?

In my application - there are four buttons named as follows:  Top - left Bottom - left Top - right Bottom - right  Above the buttons there is an image view (or a UIView). Now, suppose a user taps on - top - left button. Above image / view should be rounded at that particular corner. I am having some difficulty in applying rounded corners to the UIView. Right now I am using the following code to apply the rounded corners to each view:  Above code is applying the roundness to each of corners of supplied View. Instead I just wanted to apply roundness to selected corners like - top / top+left / bottom+right etc. Is it possible? How?

What I need to do I have a timezone-unaware datetime object, to which I need to add a time zone in order to be able to compare it with other timezone-aware datetime objects.  I do not want to convert my entire application to timezone unaware for this one legacy case. What I've Tried First, to demonstrate the problem:  First, I tried astimezone:  It's not terribly surprising this failed, since it's actually trying to do a conversion.  Replace seemed like a better choice (as per Python: How to get a value of datetime.today() that is "timezone aware"?):  But as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware.  I'm getting ready to fall back to doctoring the input string to have a timezone before parsing it (I'm using dateutil for parsing, if that matters), but that seems incredibly kludgy. Also, I've tried this in both python 2.6 and python 2.7, with the same results. Context I am writing a parser for some data files.  There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator.  I've already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format.  A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons.  While in general, I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone, in this case it seems like the best option.  I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC, so I'm prepared to accept the risk of defaulting to that in this case.

How do I force an overwrite of local files on a ? The scenario is following:  A team member is modifying the templates for a website we are working on They are adding some images to the images directory (but forgets to add them under source control) They are sending the images by mail, later, to me I'm adding the images under the source control and pushing them to GitHub together with other changes They cannot pull updates from GitHub because Git doesn't want to overwrite their files.  The errors I'm getting are:  error: Untracked working tree file 'public/images/icon.gif' would be overwritten by merge.  How do I force Git to overwrite them? The person is a designer - usually I resolve all the conflicts by hand, so the server has the most recent version that they just needs to update on their computer.

I have a  with a  and I want the input data be saved always with the FIRST LETTER IN CAPITAL. Example:  How can I achieve this maximizing performance?  NOTE: Based on the answers and the comments under the answers, many people think this is asking about capitalizing all words in the string. E.g.  It isn't, but if that is what you seek, look for one of the answers that uses 's  method. (NOTE: Those answers are incorrect for the question actually asked.) See TextInfo.ToTitleCase doc for caveats (doesn't touch all-caps words - they are considered acronyms; may lowercase letters in middle of words that "shouldn't" be lowered, e.g. "McDonald" => "Mcdonald"; not guaranteed to handle all culture-specific subtleties re capitalization rules.)  NOTE: The question is ambiguous as to whether letters after the first should be forced to lower case.  The accepted answer assumes that only the first letter should be altered. If you want to force all letters in the string except the first to be lower case, look for an answer containing , and not containing ToTitleCase.

We have  to get the IP address in ASP.NET, but this is usually the user's ISP's IP address, not exactly the user's machine IP address who for example clicked a link. How can I get the real IP Address? For example, in a Stack Overflow user profile it is: "Last account activity: 4 hours ago from 86.123.127.8", but my machine IP address is a bit different. How does Stack Overflow get this address?  In some web systems there is an IP address check for some purposes. For example, with a certain IP address, for every 24 hours can the user just have only 5 clicks on download links? This IP address should be unique, not for an ISP that has a huge range of clients or Internet users. Did I understand well?

I want to use the Bootstrap 3 default navbar with an image logo instead of text branding. What's the proper way of doing this without causing any issues with different screen sizes? I assume this a common requirement, but I haven't yet seen a good code sample. A key requirement other than having acceptable display on all screen sizes is the menu collapsibility on smaller screens. I tried just putting an IMG tag inside the A tag that has the navbar-brand class, but that caused the menu not to function properly on my android phone. I also tried increasing the height of the navbar class, but that screwed things up even more. By the way, my logo image is larger than the height of the navbar.

So I installed the beta of JDK 8 a while ago to look at some of the examples. I thought for sure by now, it's easy to change between versions.  Doing some Play development with IntelliJ. For some reason, IntelliJ is compiling with 8 even though:  I have the compiler set in Preferences to use 1.6 Supposedly it's using SBT through external build, but sbt from the command line works JAVA_HOME is pointing to JDK 6.

How to perform left outer join in C# LINQ to objects without using  clauses? Is there any way to do that with  clause?

I have a Map which is to be modified by several threads concurrently.  There seem to be three different synchronized Map implementations in the Java API:      From what I understand,  is an old implementation (extending the obsolete  class), which has been adapted later to fit the  interface. While it is synchronized, it seems to have serious scalability issues and is discouraged for new projects. But what about the other two? What are the differences between Maps returned by  and s? Which one fits which situation?

It seems pretty simple but I can't find a good way to do it. Say in the first page I create a variable  And the form's action for that page is "Page2.php". So in Page2.php, how can I have access to that variable? I know I can do it with sessions but I think it's too much for a simple string, and I do only need to pass a simple string (a file name). How can I achieve this? Thanks!

I can't compile/debug our Android app, because the localization files are not perfect yet. My IDE's validation tool Lint create errors saying:  newCardsOrderVals is not translated in ar, bg, ca, cs  Compiling/installing/running with Ant works fine, but I would like to use my IDE to ease debugging. Is there a way to turn off this particular check, or ideally make it a warning rather than an error? I understand that before release we will really need to get localisation files right, but for the time being it is not a priority as the screens themselves are being modified very frequently.

I'm not even sure how to do this without using some horrible for loop/counter type solution.  Here's the problem: I'm given two dates, a start date and an end date and on a specified interval I need to take some action. For example: for every date between 3/10/2009 on every third day until 3/26/2009 I need to create an entry in a List. So my inputs would be:  and my output would be a list that has the following dates: 3/13/2009 3/16/2009 3/19/2009 3/22/2009 3/25/2009 So how the heck would I do something like this? I thought about using a for loop that would iterate between every day in the range with a separate counter like so:  But it seems like there could be a better way?

I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the  activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.  The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and . This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the  for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera. The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.  Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bit wise)?   This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with touch screen because of focus issue. (I can use roller ball.)  I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.  As soon as I disabled the image on the list view it worked fine again. FYI: This is how I was doing it:  Where  is a . Here is my LogCat:  I also have a new error when displaying an image:

I want to bounce users of our web site to an error page if they're using a version of  prior to v9. It's just not worth our time and money to support . Users of all other non-IE browsers are fine and shouldn't be bounced. Here's the proposed code:  Will this code do the trick? To head off a few comments that will probably be coming my way:  Yes, I know that users can forge their  string. I'm not concerned. Yes, I know that programming pros prefer sniffing out feature-support instead of browser-type but I don't feel this approach makes sense in this case. I already know that all (relevant) non-IE browsers support the features that I need and that all  browsers don't. Checking feature by feature throughout the site would be a waste. Yes, I know that someone trying to access the site using  (or >= 20) wouldn't get 'badBrowser' set to true and the warning page wouldn't be displayed properly. That's a risk we're willing to take. Yes, I know that Microsoft has "conditional comments" that can be used for precise browser version detection. IE no longer supports conditional comments as of , rendering this approach absolutely useless.  Any other obvious issues to be aware of?

I've seen a couple of questions in regards to bootstrap modals, but none exactly like this, so I'll go ahead.  I have a modal that I call onclick like so...   This works fine, but when I show the modal I want to focus on the first input element... In may case the first input element has an id of #photo_name.  So I tried  But this was to no avail. Lastly, I tried binding to the 'show' event but even so, the input won't focus. Lastly just for testing, as I had a suspiscion this is about the js loading order, I put in a setTimeout just to see if I delay a second, will the focus work, and yes, it works! But this method is obviously crap. Is there some way to have the same effect as below without using a setTimeout?

I'm designing my database schema using MySQL Workbench, which is pretty cool because you can do diagrams and it converts them :P Anyways, I've decided to use InnoDB because of it's Foreign Key support. One thing I noticed though is that it allows you to set On Update and on Delete options for foreign keys. Can someone explain where "Restrict", "Cascade" and set null could be used in a simple example? For example, say I have a  table which includes a . And say I have a message table  which is a many-to-many which has 2 foreign keys (which reference the same primary key,  in the  table). Is setting the On Update and On Delete options any useful in this case? If so, which one do I choose? If this isn't a good example, could you please come up with a good example to illustrate how these could be useful? Thanks
C and C++ have many differences, and not all valid C code is valid C++ code. (By "valid" I mean standard code with defined behavior, i.e. not implementation-specific/undefined/etc.) Is there any scenario in which a piece of code valid in both C and C++ would produce different behavior when compiled with a standard compiler in each language? To make it a reasonable/useful comparison (I'm trying to learn something practically useful, not to try to find obvious loopholes in the question), let's assume:  Nothing preprocessor-related (which means no hacks with , pragmas, etc.)   Anything implementation-defined is the same in both languages (e.g. numeric limits, etc.) We're comparing reasonably recent versions of each standard (e.g. say, C++98 and C90 or later) If the versions matter, then please mention which versions of each produce different behavior.
I am currently trying to put a  in a different location rather than at the top of my view controller. With this said, it is trying to add the header in the top to account for the navigation bar, but this is not needed since I do not have at the top of my controller. If I put the top left corner of the  where I want the cells to be, it doesn't put the cells there:  Now, if I just move the table view up so the cells are in the correct place, I get a different problem - the cells can be moved up to there when scrolling (this is with my finger above the navigation controller):  When I let go, yes - the cells will go right below the search bar, but this is obviously a problem how you can bring them above it. How would I go about doing this? Is there any easier way?

I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET)  There is a main form which hosts some user control. The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the  method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution. To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)   I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.   Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl.   The pseudocode would look like this: CODE 1  The Exception it gave was  Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.  To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code CODE 2  BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one. The Application again  become nonresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned. I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading. How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block? The situation is this: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don't want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I'm not going to do it ever from a child thread.  So only accessing the value so that the corresponding data can be fetched from the database.
I'm using git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:  : import of existing codebase plus a few mods that I'm generally sure of  : experimental branch #1 : experimental branch #2   and  represent two very different architectural approaches.  Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work.  As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those. What is the best way to merge selective files from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else? Approaches I've considered:   followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches. Manual copying of common files into a temp directory followed by  to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temp directory into the working tree. A variation on the above.  Abandon the  branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.  All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make  more selective.

I've been using Git on both Windows and Ubuntu during the development of a small project, frequently flipping back and forth between the two.  The issue I'm having is that Git/Bash consistently become slow.  When I say slow, I mean that running  takes anywhere from 8-25 seconds, running  commands take from 5-20 seconds, and  can take up to 30 seconds sometimes.  Needless to say, this is not fun, not to mention unproductive.  I know Git is slower on Windows, but this is ridiculous. The one solution which has worked--temporarily--for me has been to disable my network connection (as suggested in this answer), start git, and then reconnect.  Sometimes it continues to run quickly for days after doing that, but the performance always degrades eventually.  I've trawled through the msysgit discussion group, SO, msysgit issue list, etc. on and off for weeks, but I haven't been able to turn up solutions which work. So far, I've tried:  Adding git & project folders to virus scanner's exclusion list Disabling my virus scanner completely (Kaspersky IS 2011) Ensuring that Outlook is not running (Outlook 2007) Shutting down all other applications Running git as administrator Disabling network connection, starting git, and keeping connection disabled Disabling network connection, starting git, re-enabling connection (works only occasionally) Running git gc And combinations of the above  I did read that a couple people had success disabling bash completion, but ideally I'd like to keep that active.  The version of msysgit is 1.7.3.1-preview20101002 & the OS is Windows 7 x64.  Running the same things on Linux is, predictably, lightning fast.  I would use Linux exclusively, but I need to run stuff in Windows, too (certain apps, testing, etc.). Has anyone encountered a similar issue?  If so, what was the underlying problem and what was the solution (if any)? Edit: This extends beyond just the git repositories, but just for reference, the repos I've been using git with have been pretty small: ~4-50 files max.

How do you test an element for existence without the use of the  method? I have setup a live demo for reference. I will also print the code on here as well:  Basically what the above code demonstrates is an element being stored into a variable and then removed from dom. Even though the element has been removed from the dom, the variable retains the element as it was when first declared. In other words, it is not a live reference to the element itself, but rather a replica. As a result, checking the variable's value (the element) for existence will provide an unexpected result. The  function is my attempt to check for an elements existence from a variable, and it works, but I would like to know if there is an easier way to accomplish the same result. PS: I'm also interested in why JavaScript variables behave like this if anyone knows of some good articles related to the subject.
This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'. I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate. Best methods:  Method 1: A decorator  Pros  Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.  Cons  While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for  then    Method 2: A base class  Pros  It's a true class  Cons  Multiple inheritance - eugh!  could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.   Method 3: A metaclass  Pros  It's a true class Auto-magically covers inheritance Uses  for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)  Cons  Are there any?   Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name  Pros  It's a true class Auto-magically covers inheritance  Cons  Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern... What is the point of the  attribute Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using  because they will recurse. This means you can't customize  and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to .

I guess most of you, developers, use any VCS, and I hope some of you use Git. Do you have any tip or trick how to get a download URL for a single file in a repository?

This seems like something that should be pretty straight forward, but I have been stuck page faulting this problem for a while now, so here goes. Having a look on the PHP documentation , the following two methods of the DateTime object would both seem to solve my problem:  DateTime::diff : Get the difference and use that to determine which is more ancient. DateTime::getTimestamp : Get the UNIX timestampt and compare those.  Both these methods are marked in the doco as being available in version >= 5.3 (and, not surprisingly, if I try to call them I find they don't exist). I can't find any specific documentation for 5.2.8 so I am not sure if there are equivalent methods in my version.  I have Googled the problem and found an eclectic range of solutions, none of which answer my very simple requirements:  How do I compare two DateTime objects? Where can I find the doco for previous PHP versions? Specifically version 5.2.8?  For some context, I have the following code:  Apparently there is no comparison operator on this guy.   EDIT: Apparently my assumptions  were completely false (thanks Milen for illustrating this so effectively).  There is a comparison operator and it works just fine thanks.  Sometimes I really miss a compiler.  The bug is in the code above, I am sure you will find it much faster than I did :). I look forward to my embarrassment at the simplicity of your solution. EDIT: And sure enough, embarrassment ensues ...
I have always thought that functional programming can be done in Python. Thus, I was surprised that Python didn't get much of a mention in this question, and when it was mentioned, it normally wasn't very positive. However, not many reasons were given for this (lack of pattern matching and algebraic data types were mentioned). So my question is: why isn't Python very good for functional programming? Are there more reasons than its lack of pattern matching and algebraic data types? Or are these concepts so important to functional programming that a language that doesn't support them can only be classed as a second rate functional programming language? (Keep in mind that my experience with functional programming is quite limited.)
This is a probably an embarasing question as no doubt the answer is blindingly obvious. I've used Visual Studio for years, but this is the first time I've done any 'Console Application' development. When I run my application the console window pops up, the program output appears and then the window closes as the application exits. Is there a way to either keep it open until I have checked the output, or view the results after the window has closed?
Is it possible to cancel a  animation while it is in progress? Or would I have to drop to the CA level? i.e. I've done something like this (maybe setting an end animation action too):  But before the animation completes and I get the animation ended event, I want to cancel it (cut it short).

The character 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family with two women, one girl, and one boy) is encoded as such:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   So it's very interestingly-encoded; the perfect target for a unit test. However, Swift doesn't seem to know how to treat it. Here's what I mean:  So, Swift says it contains itself (good) and a boy (good!). But it then says it does not contain a woman, girl, or zero-width joiner. What's happening here? Why does Swift know it contains a boy but not a woman or girl? I could understand if it treated it as a single character and only recognized it containing itself, but the fact that it got one subcomponent and no others baffles me. This does not change if I use something like .  Even more confounding is this:  Even though I placed the ZWJs in there, they aren't reflected in the character array. What followed was a little telling:  So I get the same behavior with the character array... which is supremely annoying, since I know what the array looks like. This also does not change if I use something like .

OK, so the  annotation is good for marking that a test case shouldn't be run. However, sometimes I want to ignore a test based on runtime information.  An example might be if I have a concurrency test that needs to be run on a machine with a certain number of cores.  If this test were run on a uniprocessor machine, I don't think it would be correct to just pass the test (since it hasn't been run), and it certainly wouldn't be right to fail the test and break the build. So I want to be able to ignore tests at runtime, as this seems like the right outcome (since the test framework will allow the build to pass but record that the tests weren't run).  I'm fairly sure that the annotation won't give me this flexibility, and suspect that I'll need to manually create the test suite for the class in question.  However, the documentation doesn't mention anything about this and looking through the API it's also not clear how this would be done programmatically (i.e. how do I programatically create an instance of  or similar that is equivalent to that created by the  annotation?). If anyone has done something similar in the past, or has a bright idea of how else I could go about this, I'd be happy to hear about it.

I have an Excel file that has some Spanish characters (tildes, etc.) that I need to convert to a CSV file to use as an import file.

I've to admit that I don't know much about functional programming. I read about it from here and there, and so came to know that in functional programming, a function returns the same output, for same input, no matter how many times the function is called.  It's exactly like mathematical function which evaluates to same output for same value of input parameter which involves in the function expression.  For example, consider this:  No matter how many times you use , its value will always be . As such, wherever you've written , you can replace it with , without altering the value of the whole expression. This property is referred to as referential transparency of an expression. As Wikipedia says (link),  Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times.   So my question is: can a time function (which returns the current time) exist in functional programming?   If yes, then how can it exist? Does it not violate the principle of functional programming? It particularly violates referential transparency which is one of the property of functional programming (if I correctly understand it). Or if no, then how can one know the current time in functional programming?

Update:  Again thanks for the examples, they have been very helpful and with the following I don't mean  to take anything away from them. Aren't the currently given examples, as far as I understand them & state-machines, only half of what we usually understand by a state-machine? In the sense that the examples do change state but that's only represented by changing the value of a variable (and allowing different value- changes in different states), while usually a state machine should also change it's behavior, and behavior not (only) in the sense of allowing different value changes for a variable depending on state, but in the sense of allowing different methods to be executed for different states. Or do I have a misconception of state machines and their common use? Best regards  Original question:  I found this discussion about state machines & iterator blocks in c# and tools to create state machines and what not for C#, so I found a lot of abstract stuff but as a noob all of this is a little confusing. So it would be great if someone could provide a C# source code-example that realizes a simple state machine with perhaps 3,4 states, just to get the gist of it.

Real World Haskell states:  The familiar seq function evaluates an expression to what we call head   normal form (abbreviated HNF). It stops once it reaches the outermost   constructor (the “head”). This is distinct from normal form (NF), in   which an expression is completely evaluated. You will also hear Haskell programmers refer to weak head normal form   (WHNF). For normal data, weak head normal form is the same as head   normal form. The difference only arises for functions, and is too   abstruse to concern us here.  I have read a few resources and definitions (Haskell Wiki and Haskell Mail List and Free Dictionary) but I don't get it. Can someone perhaps give an example or provide a layman definition? I am guessing it would be similar to:  How do  and  relate to WHNF and HNF? Update I am still confused. I know some of the answers say to ignore HNF. From reading the various definitions it seems that there is no difference between regular data in WHNF and HNF. However, it does seem like there is a difference when it comes to a function. If there was no difference, why is  necessary for ? Another point of confusion is from the Haskell Wiki, which states that  reduces to WHNF, and will do nothing to the following example. Then they say that they have to use  to force the evaluation. Is that not forcing it to HNF?  Common newbie stack overflowing code:  People who understand seq and weak head normal form (whnf) can   immediately understand what goes wrong here. (acc+x, len+1) is already   in whnf, so seq, which reduces a value to whnf, does nothing to this.   This code will build up thunks just like the original foldl example,   they'll just be inside a tuple. The solution is just to force the   components of the tuple,  e.g.   -Haskell Wiki on Stackoverflow

How to wait in a bash script for several subprocesses spawned from that script to finish and return exit code !=0 when any of the subprocesses ends with code !=0 ? Simple script:  The above script will wait for all 10 spawned subprocesses, but it will always give exit status 0 (see ). How can I modify this script so it will discover exit statuses of spawned subprocesses and return exit code 1 when any of subprocesses ends with code !=0? Is there any better solution for that than collecting PIDs of the subprocesses, wait for them in order and sum exit statuses?

Entities may have been modified or deleted since entities were loaded. Refresh ObjectStateManager entries.  I can't figure out how to reproduce this. But it might have something to do with how close together I make the updates. Has anyone seen this or does anyone know what the error message refers to?

I'm really new to setting up web servers in general. I've got IIS 8 on Windows 8, and I'm trying to set up a little site locally, while doing some development. In IIS I choose Add Site, give a name, points to a location where I have a index.html file (I've tried different locations, latest in a c:\inetpub\wwwroot\test -folder) and otherwise use all default settings. However, when I try to browse to localhost I get   HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable.  I've verified the pool is started, and I've given IIS_IUSRS Full Control on the target folder I've search around but not found anything that solved my issue, and there's nothing helpfull in the EventLog or in the C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR folder Could anyone tell me what's wrong?
I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected. With a top-level  this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the  method just returns an object). Here's a code example:  Clicking the button internally calls , but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by  doesn't change). However, if I simply call  instead of , it works fine. So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?

Apparently, the following is valid syntax  I would like to know:  What does this  character in front of the string mean? What are the effects of using it? What are appropriate situations to use it?  I found a related question right here on SO, but that question is about PHP though, and it states the  is used to indicate the string is binary, as opposed to Unicode, which was needed for code to be compatible from version of PHP < 6, when migrating to PHP 6. I don't think this applies to Python. I did find this documentation on the Python site about using a  character in the same syntax to specify a string as Unicode. Unfortunately, it doesn't mention the b character anywhere in that document. Also, just out of curiosity, are there more symbols than the  and  that do other things?

I'm having problems dealing with unicode characters from text fetched from different web pages (on different sites). I am using BeautifulSoup.  The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a . I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error. One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:  Here is a stack trace produced on SOME strings when the snippet above is run:  I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English. Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this so that I can CONSISTENTLY fix this problem?

I am reading an awesome OpenGL tutorial. It's really great, trust me. The topic I am currently at is Z-buffer. Aside from explaining what's it all about, the author mentions that we can perform custom depth tests, such as GL_LESS, GL_ALWAYS, etc. He also explains that the actual meaning of depth values (which is top and which isn't) can also be customized. I understand so far. And then the author says something unbelievable:  The range zNear can be greater than the range zFar; if it is, then the   window-space values will be reversed, in terms of what constitutes   closest or farthest from the viewer. Earlier, it was said that the window-space Z value of 0 is closest and   1 is farthest. However, if our clip-space Z values were negated, the   depth of 1 would be closest to the view and the depth of 0 would be   farthest. Yet, if we flip the direction of the depth test (GL_LESS to   GL_GREATER, etc), we get the exact same result. So it's really just a   convention. Indeed, flipping the sign of Z and the depth test was once   a vital performance optimization for many games.  If I understand correctly, performance-wise, flipping the sign of Z and the depth test is nothing but changing a  comparison to a  comparison. So, if I understand correctly and the author isn't lying or making things up, then changing  to  used to be a vital optimization for many games. Is the author making things up, am I misunderstanding something, or is it indeed the case that once  was slower (vitally, as the author says) than ? Thanks for clarifying this quite curious matter! Disclaimer: I am fully aware that algorithm complexity is the primary source for optimizations. Furthermore, I suspect that nowadays it definitely wouldn't make any difference and I am not asking this to optimize anything. I am just extremely, painfully, maybe prohibitively curious.

I'm new to Angular and trying to get up to speed with the new way of doing things. I'd like to bind a select element to a list of objects -- which is easy enough:  In this case, it appears that selectedValue would be a number -- the id of the selected item. However, I'd actually like to bind to the country object itself so that selectedValue is the object rather than just the id.  I tried changing the value of the option like so:  but this does not seem to work.  It seems to place an object in my selectedValue -- but not the object that I'm expecting.  You can see this in my Plunker example. I also tried binding to the change event so that I could set the object myself based on the selected id; however, it appears that the change event fires before the bound ngModel is updated -- meaning I don't have access to the newly selected value at that point. Is there a clean way to bind a select element to an object with Angular 2?

Traditionally I use custom domains with my localhost development server. Something along the lines of:  This has provided me a ton of flexibility when working with external API's such as Facebook. This has worked great in the past with the built in Visual Studio Development Server, because all I needed to do was add a CNAME to those DNS records pointing to . However I have not been able to get this to work with IIS Express. Everything I have tried seems to have failed.

Whenever I enter this line and try to request  I get the following message:  Bad Request - Invalid Hostname  Does anybody know if I am missing something obvious? Or did the IIS Express team really lack the foresight to see this type of use?
I am trying to understand this particular difference between the direct and delegated event handlers using the jQuery .on() method. Specifically, the last sentence in this paragraph:  When a  is provided, the event handler is referred to as delegated. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector. jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector.  What does it mean by "runs the handler for any elements"? I made a test page to experiment with the concept. But both following constructs lead to the same behavior:  or,  Maybe someone could refer to a different example to clarify this point? Thanks.

I've recently come across the const keyword in javascript. From what i can tell, it is used to create immutable variables, and I've tested to ensure that it cannot be redefined (in node.js):  I realise that it is not yet standardised across all browsers - but I'm only interested in the context of node.js/v8, and I've noticed that certain developers / projects seem to favour it heavily when the var keyword could be used to the same effect. Questions? When is it appropriate to use const in place of var?  Should it be used every time a variable which is not going to be re-assigned is declared?  Does it actually make any difference if var is used in place of const or vice-versa?

I'm building an app that needs to show a confirm dialog in some situations. Let's say I want to remove something, then I'll dispatch an action like  so some reducer will catch that event and will fill the dialog reducer in order to show it. My doubt comes when this dialog submits.  How can this component dispatch the proper action according to the first action dispatched? Should the action creator handle this logic? Can we add actions inside the reducer?  edit: to make it clearer:  So I'm trying to reuse the dialog component. Showing/hiding the dialog it's not the problem as this can be easily done in the reducer. What I'm trying to specify is how to dispatch the action from the right side according to the action that starts the flow in the left side.

In this loop I use  to keep the thread snoozing until something of interest happens. One of the event handles I wait on is a "" event so that I can break out of the loop. This event is signaled when from my overridden .  I read somewhere that  is really intended for operations that you don't want to tie up the UI with and have an finite end - like downloading a file, or processing a sequence of items. In this case the "end" is unknown and only when the window is closed. Therefore would it be more appropriate for me to use a background Thread instead of  for this purpose?

I have a string in a Java server application that is accessed using AJAX.

I am creating a program that will download a .jar (java) file from a web server, by reading the URL that is specified in the .jad file of the same game/application. I'm using Python 3.2.1 I've managed to extract the URL of the JAR file from the JAD file (every JAD file contains the URL to the JAR file), but as you may imagine, the extracted value is type() string.  Here's the relevant function:  However I always get an error saying that the type in the function above has to be bytes, and not string. I've tried using the URL.encode('utf-8'), and also bytes(URL,encoding='utf-8'), but I'd always get the same or similar error. So basically my question is how to download a file from a server when the URL is stored in a string type?
How can I detect any text changes in a textField? The delegate method  works for something, but it did not fulfill my need exactly.

I have local changes to a file that I don't want to commit to my repository. It is a configuration file for building the application on a server, but I want to build locally with different settings. Naturally, the file always shows up when i do 'git status' as something to be staged. I would like to hide this particular change and not commit it. I won't make any other changes to the file. After some digging around, I see 2 options: 'assume-unchanged' and 'skip-worktree'. A previous question here talks about them but doesn't really explain their differences. My question is this: how are the two commands different? Why would someone use one or the other?

Overview I'm relatively familiar with , not so much with .  I've read through some  vignettes and examples that have popped up on SO, and so far my conclusions are that:   and  are comparable in speed, except when there are many (i.e. >10-100K) groups, and in some other circumstances (see benchmarks below)  has more accessible syntax  abstracts (or will) potential DB interactions There are some minor functionality differences (see "Examples/Usage" below)  In my mind 2. doesn't bear much weight because I am fairly familiar with it , though I understand that for users new to both it will be a big factor.  I would like to avoid an argument about which is more intuitive, as that is irrelevant for my specific question asked from the perspective of someone already familiar with .  I also would like to avoid a discussion about how "more intuitive" leads to faster analysis (certainly true, but again, not what I'm most interested about here). Question What I want to know is:  Are there analytical tasks that are a lot easier to code with one or the other package for people familiar with the packages (i.e. some combination of keystrokes required vs. required level of esotericism, where less of each is a good thing). Are there analytical tasks that are performed substantially (i.e. more than 2x) more efficiently in one package vs. another.  One recent SO question got me thinking about this a bit more, because up until that point I didn't think  would offer much beyond what I can already do in .  Here is the  solution (data at end of Q):  Which was much better than my hack attempt at a  solution.  That said, good  solutions are also pretty good (thanks Jean-Robert, Arun, and note here I favored single statement over the strictly most optimal solution):  The syntax for the latter may seem very esoteric, but it actually is pretty straightforward if you're used to  (i.e. doesn't use some of the more esoteric tricks). Ideally what I'd like to see is some good examples were the  or  way is substantially more concise or performs substantially better. Examples  Usage    does not allow grouped operations that return arbitrary number of rows (from eddi's question, note: this looks like it will be implemented in dplyr 0.5, also, @beginneR shows a potential work-around using  in the answer to @eddi's question).  supports rolling joins (thanks @dholstius) as well as overlap joins  internally optimises expressions of the form  or  for speed through automatic indexing which uses binary search while using the same base R syntax. See here for some more details and a tiny benchmark.  offers standard evaluation versions of functions (e.g. , ) that can simplify the programmatic use of  (note programmatic use of  is definitely possible, just requires some careful though, substitution/quoting, etc, at least to my knowledge)   Benchmarks   I ran my own benchmarks and found both packages to be comparable in "split apply combine" style analysis, except when there are very large numbers of groups (>100K) at which point  becomes substantially faster. @Arun ran some benchmarks on joins, showing that  scales better than  as the number of groups increase (updated with recent enhancements in both packages and recent version of R).  Also, a benchmark when trying to get unique values has  ~6x faster. (Unverified) has  75% faster on larger versions of a group/apply/sort while  was 40% faster on the smaller ones (another SO question from comments, thanks danas). Matt, the main author of , has benchmarked grouping operations on ,  and python  on up to 2 billion rows (~100GB in RAM). An older benchmark on 80K groups has  ~8x faster  Data This is for the first example I showed in the question section.

What is this? This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list.  Why is this? It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.¹ The main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it's easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual. ¹ Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow does support special characters. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g.  What should I do here? If you have been pointed here by someone because you have asked such a question, please find the particular syntax below.

I currently have an app displaying the build number in its title window.  That's well and good except it means nothing to most of the users, who want to know if they have the latest build - they tend to refer to it as "last Thursday's" rather than build 1.0.8.4321. The plan is to put the build date there instead - So "App built on 21/10/2009" for example. I'm struggling to find a programmatic way to pull the build date out as a text string for use like this. For the build number, I used:  after defining how those came up. I'd like something like that for the compile date (and time, for bonus points).

Programming language books explain that value types are created on the stack, and reference types are created on the heap, without explaining what these two things are. I haven't read a clear explanation of this.  I understand what a stack is, but where and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?    To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime? What is their scope? What determines the size of each of them? What makes one faster?

A few years ago I installed Apache 2.2x and PHP 5.3.1 on a Linux server I maintain.  I used .tar.gz's and built them as instructed (instead of rpms and what-have-you). And all was fine. Today I need to install this which seems like a PHP library.  I went through all the steps up to make install, and I find ibm_db2.so in  The great catch is the last step is to configure php.ini but there is NO php.ini on my system. Horror of horrors. PHP works fine, except of course for this new-fangled ibm_db2 thingamagic that I want to use so somebody can use a GUI to tinker with . (I tried a small php script which fails and indicates that the ibm_db2 functions are not available). I have to deal with PHP once every few years, so please enlighten me at a very basic level about what I could do to enable web-based GUI access to .
I've thought of some less than elegant ways to solve this, but I know I must be missing something. My  fires off immediately without any interaction with the user, and this is undesired behavior.

How can I stop this from firing off before the user can touch the control?
Two-part question from an iOS developer learning Android, working on an Android project that will make a variety of requests from JSON to image to streaming download of audio and video:  On iOS I have used the AFNetworking project extensively. Is there an equivalent library for Android? I've read up on OkHTTP and Retrofit by Square, as well as Volley but dont yet have experience developing with them. I'm hoping someone can provide some concrete examples of best use cases for each. From what I've read, seems like OkHTTP is the most robust of the three, and could handle the requirements of this project (mentioned above).

I have to maintain a large number of classic ASP pages, many of which have tabular data with no sort capabilities at all. Whatever order the original developer used in the database query is what you're stuck with. I want to to tack on some basic sorting to a bunch of these pages, and I'm doing it all client side with javascript. I already have the basic script done to sort a given table on a given column in a given direction, and it works well as long as the table is limited by certain conventions we follow here.   What I want to do for the UI is just indicate sort direction with the caret character ( ^ ) and ... what?  Is there a special character that is the direct opposite of a caret?  The letter  won't quite cut it.  Alternatively, is there another character pairing I can use?

Is there any reason to keep  in python, or is it a vestige of Python's pre-garbage collection days?

I was only able to give a brute force solution which was to sort the array in O(nlogn) time complexity and take the last 100 numbers.   The interviewer was looking for a better time complexity, I tried a couple of other solutions but failed to answer him. Is there a better time complexity solution?

I have created a self-signed SSL certificate for the localhost CN. Firefox accepts this certificate after initially complaining about it, as expected. Chrome and IE, however, refuse to accept it, even after adding the certificate to the system certificate store under Trusted Roots.

What am I supposed to do to get Chrome to accept the certificate and stop complaining about it?

So the customer doesn't have to click through the main app link.  Thanks. EDIT: starting a bounty on this due to the lack of response.  Just to make sure it is crystal clear:  I am aware that I can link to my app's page in the store, and ask the user to click from there to the "review this app" screen.

What the difference is between  and  in SQLAlchemy? I've read the docs, but am none the wiser - they seem to assume a pre-understanding that I don't have. I'm particularly interested in their impact on memory usage.

I'm wondering if I'm using too many  and not enough  calls - but without really understanding what the difference is, it's hard to to tell!
I have a Java application that uses JDBC (via JPA) that was connecting to a development database using hostname, port and Oracle SID, like this: jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle.hostserver1.mydomain.ca:1521:XYZ XYZ was the Oracle SID.

DataGridView, for example, lets you do this:  but for the life of me I can't find the documentation on the index/square-bracket operator.  What do they call it?  Where is it implemented?  Can it throw?  How can I do the same thing in my own classes? ETA: Thanks for all the quick answers.  Briefly: the relevant documentation is under the "Item" property; the way to overload is by declaring a property like ; the indexer for DataGridView does not throw, at least according to the documentation.  It doesn't mention what happens if you supply invalid coordinates. ETA Again: OK, even though the documentation makes no mention of it (naughty Microsoft!), it turns out that the indexer for DataGridView will in fact throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if you supply it with invalid coordinates.  Fair warning.
I'm looking to accept digits and the decimal point, but no sign.   I've looked at samples using the NumericUpDown control for WinForms, and this sample of a NumericUpDown custom control from Microsoft. But so far it seems like NumericUpDown (supported by WPF or not) is not going to provide the functionality that I want. The way my app is designed, nobody in their right mind is going to want to mess with the arrows. They don't make any practical sense, in the context of my app.   So I'm looking for a simple way to make a standard WPF TextBox accept only the characters that I want. Is this possible? Is it practical?

I remember hearing Joel Spolsky mention in podcast 014 that he'd barely ever used a foreign key (if I remember correctly). However, to me they seem pretty vital to avoid duplication and subsequent data integrity problems throughout your database. Do people have some solid reasons as to why (to avoid a discussion in lines with Stack Overflow principles)? Edit: "I've yet to have a reason to create a foreign key, so this might be my first reason to actually set up one."
It's very annoying to have this limitation on my development box, when there won't ever be any users other than me. I'm aware of the standard workarounds, but none of them do exactly what I want:  authbind (The version in Debian testing, 1.0, only supports IPv4) Using the iptables REDIRECT target to redirect a low port to a high port (the "nat" table is not yet implemented for ip6tables, the IPv6 version of iptables) sudo (Running as root is what I'm trying to avoid) SELinux (or similar). (This is just my dev box, I don't want to introduce a lot of extra complexity.)  Is there some simple  variable to allow non-root processes to bind to "privileged" ports (ports less than 1024) on Linux, or am I just out of luck? EDIT: In some cases, you can use capabilities to do this.
I need a way to tell what mode the shell is in from within the shell.   I've tried looking at the platform module but it seems only to tell you about "about the bit architecture and the linkage format used for the executable": the binary is compiled as 64bit though (I'm running on OS X 10.6) so it seems to always report 64bit even though I'm using the methods described here to force 32bit mode).

The control itself is Center aligned horizontally (set through Interface Builder) The button would resemble something like this:  I'm trying to configure this with contentEdgeInset, imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets to no avail. I understand that a negative value expands the edge while a positive value shrinks it to move it closer to the center. I tried:  but this doesn't display it correctly. I've been tweaking the values but going from say -5 to -10 on the left inset value doesn't appear to move it in expected manner. -10 will scoot the text all the way to the left so I expected -5 to scoot it half way from the left side but it doesn't.  What's the logic behind insets? I'm not familiar with image placements and related terminology. I used this SO question as a reference but something about my values isn't right.

I downloaded pip and ran  and everything worked just fine. The very next step in the tutorial is to run  but before it even tries to find anything online I get an error "bash: pip: command not found". This is on Mac OS X, which I'm new too, so I'm assuming there's some kind of path setting that was not set correctly when I ran setup.py. How can I investigate further? What do I need to check to get a better idea of the exact cause of the problem? EDIT: I also tried installing Python 2.7 for Mac in the hopes that the friendly install process would do any housekeeping like editing PATH and whatever else needs to happy for everything to work according to the tutorials, but this didn't work. After installing is running 'python' still ran Python 2.6 and PATH was not updated.

I searched in Google to find the differences between a  and a . Everyone mentions that when you want to do pattern matching on the class, use case class. Otherwise use classes and also mentioning some extra perks like equals and hash code overriding. But are these the only reasons why one should use a case class instead of class?  I guess there should be some very important reason for this feature in Scala. What is the explanation or is there a resource to learn more about the Scala case classes from?
I'm trying to figure out how to define a vertical line (1dp thick) to be used as a drawable. To make a horizontal one, it's pretty straightforward:  The question is, how to make this line vertical?

This has been driving me crazy for a couple of days now, but in reality it's a problem that I've hit off and on for the last few years: With HTML/CSS how can I make an element that has a width and/or height that is 100% of it's parent element and still has proper padding or margins? By "proper" I mean that if my parent element is  tall and I specify  with  I would expect that I should get a  high element with  on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element. Now, I know that that's not how the standard box model specifies it should work (although I'd like to know why, exactly...), so the obvious answer doesn't work:  But it would seem to me that there must be SOME way of reliably producing this effect for a parent of arbitrary size. Does anyone know of a way of accomplishing this (seemingly simple) task? Oh, and for the record I'm not terribly interested in IE compatibility so that should (hopefully) make things a bit easier.  EDIT: Since an example was asked for, here's the simplest one I can think of:  The challenge is then to get the black box to show up with a 25 pixel padding on all edges without the page growing big enough to require scrollbars.

We have a database that has a bunch of records with some bad data in one column, in which an embedded editor escaped some stuff that shouldn't have been escaped and it's breaking generated links. I want to run a query to replace the bad characters in all the records, but can't figure out how to do it. I found the  function in MySQL, but how can I use it inside a query? For example, what would be the correct syntax if I wanted to replace the string  with an actual less-than angle bracket () in all records that have  in the  column? Can it be done in a single query (i.e. select and replace all in one swoop), or do I have to do multiple queries? Even if it's multiple queries, how do I use  to do the replace on the value of a field on more than one record?

I started by using the  intent, and that works well for getting to the gallery. So then I tried using the  intent to allow the user to choose camera or gallery:  But it appears I can only add one . The menu show up as expected, but the only options are Gallery and Files....no Camera).  Is there a better/easier way to do this that I'm missing? Thanks for any help.
Why does Java have transient fields?
I'm having trouble displaying the only date part of a DateTime into a textbox using TextBoxFor<,>(expression, htmlAttributes). The model is based on Linq2SQL, field is a DateTime on SQL and in the Entity model. Failed:  This trick seems to be depreciated, any string value in the object htmlAttribute is ignored. Failed:  I would like to store and display only the date part on the details/edit view, without the "00:00:00" part.

I am trying to make an autocorrect system, and when a user types a word with a capital letter, the autocorrect doesn't work. In order to fix this, I made a copy of the string typed, applied .lowercaseString, and then compared them. If the string is indeed mistyped, it should correct the word. However then the word that replaces the typed word is all lowercase. So I need to apply .uppercaseString to only the first letter. I originally thought I could use  but this apparently does not work. How can I get the first letter of the string to uppercase, and then be able to print the full string with the first letter capitalized?  Thanks for any help!

My Android Studio project used to build faster but now it takes a long time to build. Any ideas what could be causing the delays?  I have tried https://stackoverflow.com/a/27171878/391401 but no effect. I dont have any Anti virus running which could interrupt the builds. My app is not that big in size as well (around 5MB) and it used to build within few seconds but not sure what has changed.
My question is about one particular usage of static keyword. It is possible to use  keyword to cover a code block within a class which does not belong to any function. For example following code compiles:  If you remove the  keyword it complains because the variable  is . However it is possible to remove both  and  keywords and make it compile.  It is confusing for me in both ways. How am I supposed to have a code section that does not belong to any method? How is it possible to invoke it? In general, what is the purpose of this usage? Or better, where can I find documentation about this?
I have some confusion related to the .NET platform build options in Visual Studio 2008. What is the "Any CPU" compilation target, and what sort of files does it generate? I examined the output executable of this "Any CPU" build and found that they are the x86 executables (who would not see that coming!). So, is there any the difference between targeting executable to x86 vs "Any CPU"? Another thing that I noticed, is that managed C++ projects do not have this platform as an option. Why is that? Does that mean that my suspicion about "Any CPU" executables being plain 32-bit ones is right?

Is this inefficient? I'm not loading a big web page - www.cokezone.co.uk so the file size is not big. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks Andy
There are many ways the value of a  can change, including:  keypresses copy/paste modified with JavaScript auto-completed by browser or a toolbar  I want my JavaScript function to be called (with the current input value) any time it changes.  And I want it to be called right away, not just when the input loses focus. I'm looking for the cleanest and most robust way to do this across all browsers (using jQuery preferably). Example use case: On the Twitter Signup page, the username field's value gets shown in the url "http://twitter/username" below it.
Since  (currently) only supports strings as values, and in order to do that the objects need to be stringified (stored as JSON-string) before they can be stored, is there a defined limitation regarding the length of the values.

I need to consume a web service in my project. I use NetBeans so I right-clicked on my project and tried to add a new "Web Service Client". Last time I checked, this was the way to create a web service client. But it resulted in an AssertionError, saying:  java.lang.AssertionError: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: jar:file:/path/to/glassfish/modules/jaxb-osgi.jar!/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/bindinfo/binding.xsd; lineNumber: 52; columnNumber: 88; schema_reference: Failed to read schema document 'xjc.xsd', because 'file' access is not allowed due to restriction set by the accessExternalSchema property.  The default Java platform for NetBeans was JDK8 (Oracle's official version), so when I changed my netbeans.conf file and made JDK7 (from Oracle, as well) as my default, everything worked fine. So I think the problem is with JDK8.

If there is a way to make JDK8 work please share.

This question is not about when to use GET or POST in general; it is about which is the recommended one for handling logging out of a web application. I have found plenty of information on the differences between GET and POST in the general sense, but I did not find a definite answer for this particular scenario. As a pragmatist, I'm inclined to use GET, because implementing it is way simpler than POST; just drop a simple link and you're done. This seems to be case with the vast majority of websites I can think of, at least from the top of my head. Even Stack Overflow handles logging out with GET. The thing making me hesitate is the (albeit old) argument that some web accelerators/proxies pre-cache pages by going and retrieving every link they find in the page, so the user gets a faster response when she clicks on them. I'm not sure if this still applies, but if this was the case, then in theory a user with one of these accelerators would get kicked out of the application as soon as she logs in, because her accelerator would find and retrieve the logout link even if she never clicked on it. Everything I have read so far suggest that POST should be used for "destructive actions", whereas actions that do not alter the internal state of the application -like querying and such- should be handled with GET. Based on this, the real question here is: Is logging out of an application considered a destructive action/does it alter the internal state of the application?

One of the joys of working for a government healthcare agency is having to deal with all of the paranoia around dealing with PHI (Protected Health Information). Don't get me wrong, I'm all for doing everything possible to protect people's personal information (health, financial, surfing habits, etc.), but sometimes people get a little too jumpy. Case in point: One of our state customers recently found out that the browser provides the handy feature to save your password. We all know that it has been there for a while and is completely optional and is up to the end user to decide whether or not it is a smart decision to use or not. However, there is a bit of an uproar at the moment and we are being demanded to find a way to disable that functionality for our site. Question: Is there a way for a site to tell the browser not to offer to remember passwords? I've been around web development a long time but don't know that I have come across that before. Any help is appreciated.

How can I quickly determine what the root URL is for my ASP.NET MVC application?  I.e., if IIS is set to serve my application at http://example.com/foo/bar, then I'd like to be able to get that URL in a reliable way that doesn't involve getting the current URL from the request and chopping it up in some fragile way that breaks if I re-route my action. The reason that I need the base URL is that this web application calls another one that needs the root to the caller web application for callback purposes.

How can I achieve this?  The latest thing I've tried is:  But if I use 2*pi, it doesn't move at all (since it's the same position). If I try to do just pi (180 degrees), it works, but if I call the method again, it rotates backwards. EDIT:  doesn't work either. It goes to  degrees, pauses for a split second, then resets back to  degrees before it starts again.

This is a tricky one and I've always relied on techniques, such as permission-based emails (i.e. only sending to people you have permission to send to) and not using blatantly spamish terminology. Of late, some of the emails I send out programmatically have started being shuffled into people's spam folder automatically and I'm wondering what I can do about it. This is despite the fact that these particular emails are not ones that humans would mark as spam, specifically, they are emails that contain license keys that people have paid good money for, so I don't think they're going to consider them spam I figure this is a big topic in which I am essentially an ignorant simpleton.

In the Python documentation it says:  A thread can be flagged as a "daemon thread". The significance of this   flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads   are left. The initial value is inherited from the creating thread.  Does anyone have a clearer explanation of what that means or a practical example showing where you would want to set threads as ?  To clarify for me: so the only time you wouldn't set threads as daemonic is if you wanted them to continue running after the main thread exits?

I am developing a piece of software in Python that will be distributed to my employer's customers. My employer wants to limit the usage of the software with a time restricted license file. If we distribute the .py files or even .pyc files it will be easy to (decompile and) remove the code that checks the license file. Another aspect is that my employer does not want the code to be read by our customers, fearing that the code may be stolen or at least the "novel ideas". Is there a good way to handle this problem? Preferably with an off-the-shelf solution. The software will run on Linux systems (so I don't think py2exe will do the trick).
In Java, the hash code for a  object is computed as  using  arithmetic, where  is the th character of the string,  is the length of the string, and  indicates exponentiation. Why is 31 used as a multiplier? I understand that the multiplier should be a relatively large prime number. So why not 29, or 37, or even 97?

What is the simplest way to forcefully delete a directory and all its subdirectories in PowerShell? I am using PowerShell V2 in Windows 7. I have learned from several sources that the most obvious command, , does not work correctly. This includes a statement in the PowerShell V2 online help (found using ) that states:  ...Because the Recurse parameter in this cmdlet is faulty, the command uses the Get-Childitem cmdlet to get the desired files, and it uses the pipeline operator to pass them to the Remove-Item cmdlet...  I have seen various examples that use Get-ChildItem and pipe it to Remove-Item, but the examples usually remove some set of files based on a filter, not the entire directory. I am looking for the cleanest way to blow out an entire directory, files and child directories, without generating any user warning messages using the least amount of code. A one-liner would be nice if it is easy to understand.
I submitted my app a little over a week ago and got the dreaded rejection email today. It tells me that my app cannot be accepted because I'm using a non-public API; specifically, it says,  The non-public API that is included in your application is firstResponder.  Now, the offending API call is actually a solution I found here on SO:  How do I get the current first responder on the screen? I'm looking for a way that won't get my app rejected.

I have been fighting with this for a bit now. I’m trying to convert epoch to a date object. The epoch is sent to me in UTC. Whenever you pass  an epoch, it assumes it’s local epoch. I tried creating a UTC object, then using  to adjust it to the proper epoch, but the only method that seems useful is  and strings don’t help me. If I pass that string into a new date, it should notice that it’s UTC, but it doesn’t.  My next attempt was to try to get the difference between local current epoch and UTC current epoch, but I wasn’t able to get that either.  It’s only giving me very small differences, under 1000, which is in milliseconds. Any suggestions?

Is there any way that I can check if an element is visible in pure JS (no jQuery) ? So, for example, in this page: Performance Bikes, if you hover over Deals (on the top menu), a window of deals appear, but at the beginning it was not shown. It is in the HTML but it is not visible. So, given a DOM element, how can I check if it is visible or not? I tried:  but it doesn't seem to be working.  I wonder which attributes should I check. It comes to my mind:  Any others that I might be missing?

I am using PyCharm to work on a project.  The project is opened and configured with an interpreter, and can run successfully.  The remote interpreter paths are mapped properly.  This seems to be the correct configuration, but PyCharm is highlighting my valid code with "unresolved reference" errors, even for built-in Python functions.  Why don't these seem to be detected, even though the code runs?  Is there any way to get PyCharm to recognize these correctly?  This specific instance of the problem is with a remote interpreter, but the problem appears on local interpreters as well.

I need to increment the month of a datetime value  when the month is 12, it becomes 13 and raises error "month must be in 1..12". (I expected the year would increment) I wanted to use timedelta, but it doesn't take month argument. There is relativedelta python package, but i don't want to install it just only for this. Also there is a solution using strtotime.  I don't want to convert from datetime to str then to time, and then to datetime; therefore, it's still a library too Does anyone have any good and simple solution just like using timedelta?
Since I use Maven I have been able to build and install in my local repository projects that have incomplete Javadoc tags (for example, a missing parameter).  However, since I migrated to Java 8 (1.8.0-ea-b90) Maven is absolutely strict about missing documentation tags and show me lots of Javadoc errors related to Javadoc problems when I try to build or install a project where the Javadoc is not "perfect". Some of the projects I am trying to compile and install in my local repository are third party projects from which I do not have control. So the workaround of just fixing all the Javadocs in all these projects does not seem to be feasable in my scenario. This is a small part of the output I see when I execute  in my project:  The Javadoc Maven plugin is configured like this in my POM:  As I said before, everything is working fine if I go back to Java 7.  Maybe is this a bug related to Maven running in Java 8? How could I make it work (i.e., being able to build the Javadoc of the project and install its code in my local repository) with Java 8? I have tested with both Maven 3.0.3 and 3.0.5 in OSX. UPDATE: If I change my Javadoc plugin configuration with  (thanks Martin):  Then the project is installed in my local repository. However, the Javadoc JAR is still not generated.

I'm sending mail from Jenkins to an anonymous SMTP relay internally. That relay then securely sends mail to exchange online via TLS on port 587. The transport works perfectly, the issue is that Microsoft requires the Sender address match the authentication credentials login name which is the same as the account email address. For example sake, say this is foo@mycompany.com. How can I make jenkins always send mail from foo@mycompany.com? BTW when I say the transport works perfectly what I mean specifically is that I can drop a formatted e-mail file into the "Pickup" directory on the SMTP relay server and it is properly sent to any recipient provided the From address is foo@mycompany.com.
I'm currently designing and implementing a RESTful API in PHP. However, I have been unsuccessful implementing my initial design.  So far pretty standard, right? My problem is with the first one . I was considering sending parameters in the request body to filter the list. This is because I want to be able to specify complex filters without getting a super long url, like:  Instead I wanted to have something like:  which is much more readable and gives you great possibilities to set complex filters. Anyway,  didn't return the request body for  requests. I also tried , but the shared hosting that I'm using doesn't have . Not sure it would have helped anyway. I found this question and realized that GET probably isn't supposed to have a request body. It was a bit inconclusive, but they advised against it.  So now I'm not sure what to do. How do you design a RESTful search/filterng function? I suppose I could use , but that doesn't seem very RESTful.

I was working on a repository on my GitHub account and this is a problem I stumbled upon.  Node.js project with a folder with a few npm packages installed The packages were in  folder Added that folder to git repository and pushed the code to github (wasn't thinking about the npm part at that time) Realized that you don't really need that folder to be a part of the code Deleted that folder, pushed it   At that instance, the size of the total git repo was around 6MB where the actual code (all except that folder) was only around 300 KB.  Now what I am looking for in the end is a way to get rid of details of that package folder from git's history so if someone clones it, they don't have to download 6mb worth of history where the only actual files they will be getting as of the last commit would be 300KB. I looked up possible solutions for this and tried these 2 methods  Remove file from git repository (history) http://help.github.com/remove-sensitive-data/ https://gist.github.com/1588371  The Gist seemed like it worked where after running the script, it showed that it got rid of that folder and after that it showed that 50 different commits were modified. But it didn't let me push that code. When I tried to push it, it said  but showed 50 commits were modified upon a . The other 2 methods didn't help either. Now even though it showed that it got rid of that folder's history, when I checked the size of that repo on my localhost, it was still around 6MB. (I also deleted the folder but didn't see the change in the size of the repo). What I am looking to clarify is, if there's a way to get rid of not only the commit history (which is the only thing I think happened) but also those files git is keeping assuming one wants to rollback. Lets say a solution is presented for this and is applied on my localhost but cant be reproduced to that GitHub repo, is it possible to clone that repo, rollback to the first commit perform the trick and push it (or does that mean that git will still have a history of all those commits? - aka. 6MB).  My end goal here is to basically find the best way to get rid of the folder contents from git so that a user doesn't have to download 6MB worth of stuff and still possibly have the other commits that never touched the modules folder (that's pretty much all of them) in git's history. How can I do this?
I have an acute problem on my website. In Google Chrome some customers are not able to proceed to my payment page. When trying to submit a form I get this error:  This is from the JavaScript console.

I need to modify bootstrap.css to fit my website. I feel it's better to create a separate custom.css file instead of modifying bootstrap.css directly, one reason being that should bootstrap.css gets an update, I'll suffer trying to re-include all my modifications. I'll sacrifice some load time for loading, but it's negligible for the few styles I'm overriding. This train of thought is correct, right? If not, my question below may be irrelevant.  If so, how do I override bootstrap.css so that I remove the style for an anchor/class? For example, if I want to remove all the styling rules for :  I can just delete all that in bootstrap.css, but if my understanding about best practices on overriding css is correct, what should I do instead? EDIT: Sorry let me improve my question. I want to remove all those styles for legend and use parent's css values. So combining Pranav's answer, will I be doing the following?  (I was hoping there's a way to do something like the following:)

I am looking for opinions of how to handle large binary files on which my source code (web application) is dependent. We are currently discussing several alternatives:  Copy the binary files by hand.   Pro: Not sure. Contra: I am strongly against this, as it increases the likelihood of errors when setting up a new site/migrating the old one. Builds up another hurdle to take.  Manage them all with Git.   Pro: Removes the possibility to 'forget' to copy a important file Contra: Bloats the repository and decreases flexibility to manage the code-base and checkouts, clones, etc. will take quite a while.  Separate repositories.   Pro: Checking out/cloning the source code is fast as ever, and the images are properly archived in their own repository. Contra: Removes the simpleness of having the one and only Git repository on the project. It surely introduces some other things I haven't thought about.   What are your experiences/thoughts regarding this? Also: Does anybody have experience with multiple Git repositories and managing them in one project? The files are images for a program which generates PDFs with those files in it. The files will not change very often (as in years), but they are very relevant to a program. The program will not work without the files.
One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.  Some constraints on the project:  The background could be very noisy. The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits). The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight). There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can! The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely "too much" on color detection). The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle. There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.  So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):  I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation: Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library. Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:  Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on "red" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.   Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise. Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.   Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:  You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here). It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor. It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will "learn". Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.  In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:  Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least... Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:  It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small. It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes) Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map. In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.  Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned? I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)

I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and I've been trying all possible methods to install Laravel to no avail. Error messages everything I try. I'm now trying the first method in the quickstart documentation, that is, via Laravel Installer, but it says to "Make sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory in your PATH so the laravel executable is found when you run the laravel command in your terminal." so my question is, how do I do that? This may be a simple question but I'm really frustrated and would appreciate any help.

I'm getting this error:   rake aborted!   Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs,   I have already spent more hours searching google then I am willing to admit. I believe this is an execJs bug. From all the posts, this is a very common issue with rails 3.1. A js runtime is now needed by what are now standard gems like coffee-script and sass. Most of these cases were resolved by adding the gems 'execjs' and 'therubyracer' to the app Gemfile, and then running 'bundle update' and/or 'bundle install'.  But not for me. I guess I got lucky.  I am running rails 3.1.3/ruby 1.9 on an old version of Redhat Linux 4 (2.6.9-101.ELsmp) and gcc is 3.4.6.   Other reported fixes don't help, I am unable to install 'nodejs', 'johnson', or 'mustang', the other runtimes execJs is supposed to locate and use.  They won't make/install on my system. I need to fix the problem causing execJs to fail to locate 'therubyracer'. Here is the Gemfile (and bundle install says Ok):  And here is a trace:  There is nothing interesting in the development log. Here is the execjs dir:  I have also tried execjs-1.2.13.  Same problem. If I comment execjs.rb below, I can run rake without the error:  But then I don't get a runtime. I can see where the error text comes from in runtimes.rb:  So the question is, since I do have 'therubyracer' installed, why can't runtimes.rb find it? Is execJs broken?  Here it 'therubyracer':  How can I fix this?

Yesterday I recognized a ton of warnings regarding the parse.com library:   URGENT: all bitcode will be dropped because '[path]/Parse.framework/Parse(PFAnalytics.o)' was built without bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. Note: This will be an error in the future.  I am aware of the fact that I can remove those warning with this answer but am now wondering if it will have any negative impact in regards to AppStore submission and / or actual performance of my app. Xcode informs you regarding bitcode  Activating this setting indicates that the target or project should generate bitcode during compilation for platforms and architectures which support it.  For Archive builds, bitcode will be generated in the linked binary for submission to the app store.  For other builds, the compiler and linker will check whether the code complies with the requirements for bitcode generation, but will not generate actual bitcode. [ENABLE_BITCODE]  But I am not getting any really useful information out of this text.  Can I use the linked answer to circumvent the issue without any negative impact and without compromising a future AppStore submission?  What does the  actually do, will it be a non-optional requirement in the future? Are there any performance impacts if I enable / disable it?

I have designed my custom Cell in IB, subclassed it and connected my outlets to my custom class. I have three subviews in cell content which are: UIView (cdView) and two labels (titleLabel and emailLabel). Depending on data available for each row, sometimes I want to have UIView and two labels displayed in my cell and sometimes only two labels. What I am trying to do is to set constraints that way if I set UIView property to hidden or I will remove it from superview the two labels will move to the left. I tried to set UIView leading constraint to Superview (Cell content) for 10px and UILabels leading Constraints for 10 px to the next view (UIView). Later in my code   I am hiding my cell.cdView and I would like the labels to move to the left however they are staying in the same position in Cell. I tried to remove cell.cdView from superview but it didn't work either. I have attached image to clarify what I am about.  I know how to do this programatically and I am not looking for that solution. What I want is to set constraints in IB and I expect that my subviews will move dynamically if other views are removed or hidden. Is it possible to do this in IB with auto-layout?

I know there are many posts out there about the differences between these two patterns, but there are a few things that I cannot find. From what I have been reading, I see that the factory method pattern allows you to define how to create a single concrete product but hiding the implementation from the client as they will see a generic product. My first question is about the abstract factory. Is its role to allow you to create families of concrete objects in (that can depend on what specific factory you use) rather than just a single concrete object? Does the abstract factory only return one very large object or many objects depending on what methods you call? My final two questions are about a single quote that I cannot fully understand that I have seen in numerous places:  One difference between the two is that   with the Abstract Factory pattern, a   class delegates the responsibility of   object instantiation to another object   via composition whereas the Factory   Method pattern uses inheritance and   relies on a subclass to handle the   desired object instantiation.  My understanding is that the factory method pattern has a Creator interface that will make the ConcreteCreator be in charge of knowing which ConcreteProduct to instantiate. Is this what it means by using inheritance to handle object instantiation? Now with regards to that quote, how exactly does the Abstract Factory pattern delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to another object via composition? What does this mean? It looks like the Abstract Factory pattern also uses inheritance to do the construction process as well in my eyes, but then again I am still learning about these patterns. Any help especially with the last question, would be greatly appreciated.

I have an application that use managed dlls. One of those dlls return a generic dictionary:    The dictionary contains keys with upper and lower case.

But of course the following will fail since I have a case mismatch:    I was hoping the TryGetValue would have an ignore case flag like mentioned in the MSDN doc, but it seems this is not valid for generic dictionaries.   Is there a way to get the value of that dictionary ignoring the key case?  Is there a better workaround than creating a new copy of the dictionary with the proper StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase parameter?

Chrome's Developer Tools rock, but one thing they don't seem to have (that I could find) is a way to find a JavaScript function's definition. This would be super handy for me because I'm working on a site that includes many external JS files. Sure grep solves this but in the browser would be much better. I mean, the browser has to know this, so why not expose it? What I expected was something like:  Select 'Inspect Element' from page, which highlights the line in the Elements tab Right-click the line and select 'Go to function definition' Correct script is loaded in the Scripts tab and it jumps to the function definition  First off, does this functionality exist and I'm just missing it? And if it doesn't, I'm guessing this would come from WebKit, but couldn't find anything for Developer Tool feature requests or WebKit's Bugzilla.

I read that it is because there isn't a  itself but it's snapshot, so individual items cannot be distinguished from each other.  EDIT:  In the documentation (thanks to Disco S2):  As mentioned in the previous section on info windows, an info window   is not a live View, rather the view is rendered as an image onto the   map. As a result, any listeners you set on the view are disregarded   and you cannot distinguish between click events on various parts of   the view. You are advised not to place interactive components — such   as buttons, checkboxes, or text inputs — within your custom info   window.  But if Google use it, there must be some way to make it. Does anyone have any idea?

I'm trying to have an image (as the background) on a button and add dynamically, depending on what's happening during run-time, some text above/over the image. If I use  I don't even have the possibility to add text. If I use  I can add text but only define an image with  and similar XML attributes as defined here. However these attributes only combine text & image in x- and y-dimensions, meaning I can draw an image around my text, but not below/under my text (with the z-axis defined as coming out of the display). Any suggestions on how to do this? One idea would be to either extend  or  and override the -method. But with my current level of knowledge I don't really know how to do this (2D rendering). Maybe someone with more experience knows a solution or at least some pointers to start?

I find that recently often when I try to install a Python package using pip, I get the error(s) below. I found a reference online that one has to use "python2 setup.py install" from the download directory, and indeed find that this will then work if I manually find and download the package (from pypi). But, I don't know where pip is downloading packages to, and/or why it is failing in this manner. I tried to do a pip upgrade, but it also failed in a similar manner, with a bunch of "Unknown distribution option" errors (entry_points, zip_safe, test_suite, tests_require)!  pip 1.0.1 ActivePython 2.7  Trying to use ActiveState's pypm fails, because they have a smaller library base, and it doesn't include these packages.

As per the title of this question, what are the practical differences between AWS EFS, EBS and S3? My understanding of each:  S3 is a storage facility accessible any where EBS is a device you can mount onto EC2 EFS is a file system you can mount onto EC2  So why would I use EBS over EFS? Seem like they have the same use cases but minor semantic differences? Although EFS is replicated across AZs where as EBS is just a mounted device. I guess my understanding of EBS is lacking hence I'm unable to distinguish.  Why choose S3 over EFS? They both store files, scale and are replicated. I guess with S3 you have to use the SDK where as with EFS being a file system you can you standard I/O methods from your programming language of choice to create files. But is that the only real difference?

I am developing a piece of software in Python that will be distributed to my employer's customers. My employer wants to limit the usage of the software with a time restricted license file. If we distribute the .py files or even .pyc files it will be easy to (decompile and) remove the code that checks the license file. Another aspect is that my employer does not want the code to be read by our customers, fearing that the code may be stolen or at least the "novel ideas". Is there a good way to handle this problem? Preferably with an off-the-shelf solution. The software will run on Linux systems (so I don't think py2exe will do the trick).

I am developing a payment processing app for Android, and I want to prevent a hacker from accessing any resources, assets or source code from the APK file. If someone changes the .apk extension to .zip then they can unzip it and easily access all the app's resources and assets, and using dex2jar and a Java decompiler, they can also access the source code. It's very easy to reverse engineer an Android APK file - for more details see Stack Overflow question Reverse engineering from an APK file to a project. I have used the Proguard tool provided with the Android SDK. When I reverse engineer an APK file generated using a signed keystore and Proguard, I get obfuscated code. However, the names of Android components remain unchanged and some code, like key-values used in the app, remains unchanged. As per Proguard documentation the tool can't obfuscate components mentioned in the Manifest file. Now my questions are:  How can I completely avoid reverse engineering of an Android APK? Is this possible? How can I protect all the app's resources, assets and source code so that hackers can't hack the APK file in any way? Is there a way to make hacking more tough or even impossible? What more can I do to protect the source code in my APK file?

I've been wondering whether there is a good "git export" solution that creates a copy of a tree without the  repository directory.

None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to  might be option 1, because both those require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.

According to the docs, "Without middleware, Redux store only supports synchronous data flow". I don't understand why this is the case. Why can't the container component call the async API, and then  the actions?  For example, imagine a simple UI: a field and a button. When user pushes the button, the field gets populated with data from a remote server.   When the exported component is rendered, I can click the button and the input is updated correctly.  Note the  function in the  call. It dispatches an action that tells the App that it is updating, and then performs an async call. After the call finishes, the provided value is dispatched as a payload of another action. What is wrong with this approach? Why would I want to use Redux Thunk or Redux Promise, as the documentation suggests? EDIT: I searched the Redux repo for clues, and found that Action Creators were required to be pure functions in the past. For example, here's a user trying to provide a better explanation for async data flow:  The action creator itself is still a pure function, but the thunk function it returns doesn't need to be, and it can do our async calls  Action creators are no longer required to be pure. So, thunk/promise middleware was definitely required in the past, but it seems that this is no longer the case?

I was wondering what the difference between BigInt, MediumInt, and Int are... it would seem obvious that they would allow for larger numbers; however, I can make an Int(20) or a BigInt(20) and that would make seem that it is not necessarily about size. Some insight would be awesome :), just kind of curious. I have been using mysql for a while and trying to apply business needs when choosing types, but I never understood this aspect.

In the answer to this question the user lists values for  and 12 variants (see below). Where do these values come from? The documentation for  does not list this information in any place (I checked here, and here). The strings are listed in the Android styles.xml file in various places, but how do these map back to the Roboto font?  From android 4.1 / 4.2, the following Roboto font families are   available:  in combination with this  12 variants are possible:  Regular  Italic  Bold  Bold-italic  Light  Light-italic  Thin  Thin-italic Condensed regular  Condensed italic  Condensed bold  Condensed bold-italic   In the  file in the application I'm working on somebody listed this as the font family, and I'm pretty sure it's wrong:  I'd like to get the theme for our app set up correctly (which includes using fontFamily correctly) and remove all the redundancy that is in some of the styles that were created before I had a look at the file.

When I try opening Eclipse, a pop-up dialog states:  Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:/JDK/bin/client/jvm.dll"`.  Following this, Eclipse force closes. Here's a few points I'd like to make:    I checked to see if anything exists at that path. It does exist.   My Eclipse and Java SE Development Kit are both 64-bit. I checked my system, and it can handle 64-bit.   I've searched for this problem on Google and on Stack Overflow, and the only answer I found was to download the 32-bit versions of JDK and Eclipse.  Downloading the 32-bit versions is something I only want to do as a very last resort. What would be suggested to solve this issue?

It didnt work but than again not sure if I just misconfigured something.  Also, what is the best way to organize styles in a new Angular project? I'd be nice to have the sass file in the same folder as the component.

Say you have a div, say you color it green and give it a definite width, when I put stuff within it, in my case an img and another div. The idea is that the content of the container div will cause the container div to stretch out, and be a background for the contents. But when I do this, the containing div shrinks to fit the non-floating objects, and the floating objects will be either all the way out, or half out, half in, and not have any bearing on the size of the big div. Why is this? Is there something I'm missing, and how can I get floated items to stretch out the height of a containing div?

In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:  When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS   to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the   style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript   includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before   continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering   thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the   styles it needs.  My actual testing reveals something quite different:  My test harness I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:   The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example,  gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.  I use the following page to test.  When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:   When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:   I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter. What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.  Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?  It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

I have a parameter file of the form  where the parameters may be in any order but there is only one parameter per line.  I want to replace one parameter's parameter-value with a new value. I am using a line replace function posted previously (Search and replace a line in a file in Python) to replace the line which uses python's string.replace(pattern, subst).  The regular expression that I'm using works for instance in vim but doesn't appear to work in string.replace.  Here is the regular expression that I'm using:  where interfaceOpDataFile is the parameter name that I'm replacing (/i for case insensitive) and the new parameter value is the contents of the fileIn variable.  Is there a way to get python to recognize this regular expression or else is there another way to accomplish this task?  Thanks in advance.

I am trying to get the rect for an attributed string, but the boundingRectWithSize call is not respecting the size I pass in and is returning a rect with a single line height as opposed to a large height (it is a long string).

Is this broken, or do I need to do something else to have it returned a rect for wrapped text?

I was watching a Pluralsight course on React and the instructor stated that props should not be changed. I'm now reading an article (uberVU/react-guide) on props vs. state and it says   Both props and state changes trigger a render update.  Later in the article it says:  Props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration, its options if you may. They are received from above and immutable.   So props can change but they should be immutable? When should you use props and when should you use state?  If you have data that a React component needs, should it be passed through props or setup in the React component via ?

I work with Series and DataFrames on the terminal a lot. The default  for a Series returns a reducted sample, with some head and tail values, but the rest missing.

For returning from a Web API 2 controller, I can return content with the response if the response is OK (status 200) like this:  If possible, I want to use the built-in result types here when possible: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.http.results(v=vs.118).aspx My question is, for another type of response (not 200), how can I return a message (string) with it? For example, I can do this:  but not this:  Ideally I want this to be generalized so that I can send a message back with any of the implementations of IHttpActionResult. Do I need to do this (and build my own response message):  or is there a better way?
I'm trying to learn how to use git and have created a small project with an html, css, and javascript file. I made a branch from my basically empty project and then made some changes to my code. I tried staging the changes but I get the following error message:  Granted, I did run into problems trying to commit my empty project earlier and just quit git bash since I didn't know how to get out of where I somehow had gotten.  Is there any way for me to fix this or should I just start a new repository?

I've been working on a web app using Django, and I'm curious if there is a way to schedule a job to run periodically.  Basically I just want to run through the database and make some calculations/updates on an automatic, regular basis, but I can't seem to find any documentation on doing this. Does anyone know how to set this up? To clarify:  I know I can set up a  job to do this, but I'm curious if there is some feature in Django that provides this functionality.   I'd like people to be able to deploy this app themselves without having to do much config (preferably zero). I've considered triggering these actions "retroactively" by simply checking if a job should have been run since the last time a request was sent to the site, but I'm hoping for something a bit cleaner.

We're using git submodules to manage a couple of large projects that have dependencies on many other libraries we've developed. Each library is a separate repo brought into the dependant project as a submodule. During development, we often want to just go grab the latest version of every dependant submodule. Does git have a built in command to do this?  If not, how about a Windows batch file or similar that can do it?

I'm wanting to parse a string into a nullable int in C#.  ie. I want to get back either the int value of the string or null if it can't be parsed. I was kind of hoping that this would work  But that won't work, so the way I'm doing it now is I've written this extension method  Is there a better way of doing this? EDIT:  Thanks for the TryParse suggestions, I did know about that, but it worked out about the same.  I'm more interested in knowing if there is a built-in framework method that will parse directly into a nullable int?
I'd like to use JavaScript to calculate the width of a string. Is this possible without having to use a monospace typeface?

What I understand from reading the documentation is that Python has a separate namespace for functions, and if I want to use a global variable in that function, I need to use . I'm using Python 2.7 and I tried this little test  It seems things are working fine even without . I was able to access global variable without any problem. Am I missing anything? Also, following is from Python documentation:  Names listed in a global statement   must not be defined as formal   parameters or in a for loop control   target, class definition, function   definition, or import statement.  While formal parameters and class definition make sense to me, I'm not able to understand the restriction on for loop control target and function definition.

Could anyone explain what's good about OAuth2 and why we should implement it? I ask because I'm a bit confused about it — here's my current thoughts: OAuth1 (more precisely HMAC) requests seem logical, easy to understand, easy to develop and really, really secure. OAuth2, instead, brings authorization requests, access tokens and refresh tokens, and you have to make 3 requests at the very start of a session to get the data you're after. And even then, one of your requests will eventually end up failing when the token expires. And to get another access token, you use a refresh token that was passed at the same time as the access token. Does that make the access token futile from a security point of view?  Plus, as /r/netsec have showed recently, SSL isn't all entirely secure, so the push to get everything onto TLS/SSL instead of a secure HMAC confuses me. OAuth are arguing that it's not about 100% safety, but getting it published and finished. That doesn't exactly sound promising from a provider's point of view. I can see what the draft is trying to achieve when it mentions the 6 different flows, but it's just not fitting together in my head. I think it might be more my struggling to understand it's benefits and reasoning than actually disliking it, so this may be a bit of an unwarranted attack, and sorry if this could seem like a rant.

Twitter Bootstrap's buttons have a nice  state available. The thing is that it just shows a message like  passed through the  attribute like this:  Looking at Font Awesome, you see that there's now an animated spinner icon. I tried to integrate that spinner icon when firing an  operation like this:  but this had no effect at all, that is, I just see the  text on the button. Is it possible to add an icon when the button is in the Loading state? Looks like somehow Bootstrap just removes the icon  inside the button while in the Loading state.  Here's a simple demo that shows the behavior I describe above. As you see when it enters the Loading state the icon just disappears. It reappears right after the time interval.
I don't understand buffers. When I open 3 files on the same tab and close my window, I'm generally annoyed to find out next time I open one of those files that there's strange swap files lingering and giving me pesky messages. But time and time again I read that these things are the productivity nirvana I'm missing out on and that tabs were made for the plebeians to use. So I ask you, the Vim expert: what are the advantages of using buffers over tabs? I don't see how the difference could be profoundly different, but I would consider myself only at the beginner-intermediate level at operating Vim. Is   really that much faster than ing around? I feel it must go deeper than this.

I'm developing a part of an application that's responsible for exporting some data into CSV files. The application always uses UTF-8 because of its multilingual nature at all levels. But opening such CSV files (containing e.g. diacritics, cyrillic letters, Greek letters) in Excel does not achieve the expected results showing something like . And I don't know how to force Excel understand that the open CSV file is encoded in UTF-8. I also tried specifying UTF-8 BOM , but Excel ignores that. Is there any workaround? P.S. Which tools may potentially behave like Excel does?  UPDATE I have to say that I've confused the community with the formulation of the question. When I was asking this question, I asked for a way of opening a UTF-8 CSV file in Excel without any problems for a user, in a fluent and transparent way. However, I used a wrong formulation asking for doing it automatically. That is very confusing and it clashes with VBA macro automation. There are two answers for this questions that I appreciate the most: the very first answer by Alex https://stackoverflow.com/a/6002338/166589, and I've accepted this answer; and the second one by Mark https://stackoverflow.com/a/6488070/166589 that have appeared a little later. From the usability point of view, Excel seemed to have lack of a good user-friendly UTF-8 CSV support, so I consider both answers are correct, and I have accepted Alex's answer first because it really stated that Excel was not able to do that transparently. That is what I confused with automatically here. Mark's answer promotes a more complicated way for more advanced users to achieve the expected result. Both answers are great, but Alex's one fits my not clearly specified question a little better.  UPDATE 2 Five months later after the last edit, I've noticed that Alex's answer has disappeared for some reason. I really hope it wasn't a technical issue and I hope there is no more discussion on which answer is greater now. So I'm accepting Mark's answer as the best one.

I understand how this construct works:  But I don't understand why  is used as the keyword here, since it suggests the code in question only runs if the  block does not complete, which is the opposite of what it does!

I'm using Nihilogic's "Canvas2Image" JavaScript tool to convert canvas drawings to PNG images.  What I need now is to turn those base64 strings that this tool generates, into actual PNG files on the server, using PHP. In short, what I'm currently doing is to generate a file on the client side using Canvas2Image, then retrieve the base64-encoded data and send it to the server using AJAX:  At this point, "hidden.php" receives a data block that looks like data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABE... From this point on, I'm pretty much stumped. From what I've read, I believe that I'm supposed to use PHP's imagecreatefromstring function, but I'm not sure how to actually create an actual PNG image from the base64-encoded string and store it on my server. Please aid!
I have some .sql files with thousands of INSERT statements in them and need to run these inserts on my PostgreSQL database in order to add them to a table.

For a project at work, we're considering using the Maven plugin for Eclipse to automate our builds. Right now the procedure is far more complicated than it ought to be, and we're hoping that Maven will simplify things to a one-click build.  My question is, is there a wizard or automatic importer for converting an existing Eclipse Java project to a Maven project, using the Maven plugin?  Or should I create a new Maven project and manually copy over all source files, libs, etc.

I have 2 tables: T1 and T2, they are existing tables with data.  We have a one to many relationship between T1 and T2.  How do I alter the table definitions to perform cascading delete in SQL Server when a record from T1 is deleted, all associated records in T2 also deleted.  The foreign constraint is in place between them. I don't want to drop the tables or create a trigger to do the deletion for T2. For example, when I delete an employee, all the review record should be gone, too. T1 - Employee,  T2 - Performance Reviews,
I'm looking for a good JavaScript equivalent of the C/PHP  or for C#/Java programmers,  ( for .NET).

If I want to know the current value of, say , I can run:  without passing an argument, and Vim will tell me the current value.

I'm trying to plot a figure without tickmarks or numbers on either of the axes (I use axes in the traditional sense, not the matplotlib nomenclature!). An issue I have come across is where matplotlib adjusts the x(y)ticklabels by subtracting a value N, then adds N at the end of the axis. This may be vague, but the following simplified example highlights the issue, with '6.18' being the offending value of N:  The three things I would like to know are:  How to turn off this behaviour in the first place (although in most cases it is useful, it is not always!) I have looked through  and cannot find anything appropriate How can I make N disappear (i.e. ) Is there a better way to do the above anyway?

I am trying to generate a random value with Java, but in a specific range.  For example: My range is 5-10, meaning that 5 is the smallest possible value and 10 is the biggest. Any other number in between these numbers is possible to be a value, too.  In Java, there is a method  in the  class, which returns a  value between 0.0 and 1.0. In the class  there is the method , which returns a random  value in the range of 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive). I couldn't find a method, which returns a random integer value between two numbers. I have tried the following things, but I still have problems: (minimum and maximum are the smallest and biggest numbers). Solution 1:  Problem:  can be bigger than . Solution 2:  Problem:  can be smaller than . How do I solve these problems? I have tried also browsing through the archive and found:  Expand a random range from 1–5 to 1–7 Generate random numbers uniformly over an entire range  But I couldn't solve the problem.
I need to compare two s (e.g.  and ) and come up with a  which is true of the two s share the same day, and false if they are not. How can I do this? There seems to be a whirlwind of confusion here... and I would like to avoid pulling in other dependencies beyond the JDK if at all possible. to clarify: if  and  share the same year, month, and day, then  is true, otherwise it is false.

I am hoping to make this question and the answers to it the definitive guide to dealing with daylight saving time, in particular for dealing with the actual change overs.  If you have anything to add, please do Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards. For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.  How have you dealt with the daylight saving issue?  What assumptions are part of your solution? (looking for context here)  As important, if not more so:  What did you try that did not work?  Why did it not work?  I would be interested in programming, OS, data persistence and other pertinent aspects of the issue. General answers are great, but I would also like to see details especially if they are only available on one platform.

I've encountered an error deploying a site to a server.  When trying to load the home page, or access authentication on the new site in IIS, I get the error:  Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path.   This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. Locking is   either by default (overrideModeDefault="Deny"), or set explicitly by a   location tag with overrideMode="Deny" or the legacy   allowOverride="false".  More detail can be found here, in Scenario 7 matches my hex error code. The solution given on the linked site above is to set Allow for overrideModeDefault in the section mentioned in my error, in the applicationHost.config file.  In my case,  under Security in system.webServer.  But if I look at the applicationHost.config on my local computer, where the site is properly deployed already, that section is set to Deny. If this solution is correct, how is my local instance running just fine with the same web.config?  According to my applicationHost.config, that section should be locked, but it's not.  I'd prefer to not change the applicationHost.config file, because there are many other sites running on that server.  Is there another solution?

Over the years I have slowly developed a regular expression that validates MOST email addresses correctly, assuming they don't use an IP address as the server part. I use it in several PHP programs, and it works most of the time.  However, from time to time I get contacted by someone that is having trouble with a site that uses it, and I end up having to make some adjustment (most recently I realized that I wasn't allowing 4-character TLDs). What is the best regular expression you have or have seen for validating emails? I've seen several solutions that use functions that use several shorter expressions, but I'd rather have one long complex expression in a simple function instead of several short expression in a more complex function.

What am I missing here.. Can't one initialize it if the value isn't zero ? 2: Is the default initialization (as above ) faster than the usual loop through the whole array and assign a value or does it do the same thing?

I'm asking more about what this means to my code.  I understand the concepts mathematically, I just have a hard time wrapping my head around what they mean conceptually.  For example, if one were to perform an O(1) operation on a data structure, I understand that the amount of operations it has to perform won't grow because there are more items.  And an O(n) operation would mean that you would perform a set of operations on each element.  Could somebody fill in the blanks here?  Like what exactly would an O(n^2) operation do? And what the heck does it mean if an operation is O(n log(n))? And does somebody have to smoke crack to write an O(x!)?

I have a ScrollView that surrounds my entire layout so that the entire screen is scrollable.  The first element I have in this ScrollView is a HorizontalScrollView block that has features that can be scrolled through horizontally.  I've added an ontouchlistener to the horizontalscrollview to handle touch events and force the view to "snap" to the closest image on the ACTION_UP event. So the effect I'm going for is like the stock android homescreen where you can scroll from one to the other and it snaps to one screen when you lift your finger. This all works great except for one problem:  I need to swipe left to right almost perfectly horizontally for an ACTION_UP to ever register.  If I swipe vertically in the very least (which I think many people tend to do on their phones when swiping side to side), I will receive an ACTION_CANCEL instead of an ACTION_UP.  My theory is that this is because the horizontalscrollview is within a scrollview, and the scrollview is hijacking the vertical touch to allow for vertical scrolling.   How can I disable the touch events for the scrollview from just within my horizontal scrollview, but still allow for normal vertical scrolling elsewhere in the scrollview? Here's a sample of my code:  }

EDIT: IMPORTANT FOR NEW DOCKER USERS As @mohammed-noureldin and others said, actually this is NOT a container exiting. Every time it just creates a new container.

I've been reading up on STL containers in my book on C++, specifically the section on the STL and its containers. Now I do understand each and every one of them have their own specific properties, and I'm close to memorizing all of them... But what I do not yet grasp is in which scenario each of them is used. What is the explanation? Example code is much prefered.
I have a data frame. Let's call him :  I'd like to concatenate the rows of this data frame (this will be another question). But look:  's columns are factors. So, for example:  I don't begin to understand this, but I guess these are indices into the levels of the factors of the columns (of the court of king caractacus) of ? Not what I need. Strangely I can go through the columns of  by hand, and do  which works fine. And, after some typing, I can get a data.frame whose columns are characters rather than factors. So my question is: how can I do this automatically? How do I convert a data.frame with factor columns into a data.frame with character columns without having to manually go through each column?  Bonus question: why does the manual approach work?

I have seen so many purported "standards" for the JSON content type:  But which is correct, or best? I gather that there are security and browser support issues varying between them. I know there's a similar question, What MIME type if JSON is being returned by a REST API?, but I'd like a slightly more targeted answer.
I created a new local Git repository:  Is there any git command to create a new remote repo and push my commit to GitHub from here? I know it's no big deal to just fire up a browser and head over to Create a New Repository, but if there is a way to achieve this from the CLI I would be happy. I read a vast amount of articles but none that I found mention how to create a remote repo from the CLI using git commands. Tim Lucas's nice article Setting up a new remote git repository is the closest I found, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

I would like to place an icon left of the two lines of text such that there's about 2-3 pixels of space between the image and the start of text. The control itself is Center aligned horizontally (set through Interface Builder) The button would resemble something like this:  I'm trying to configure this with contentEdgeInset, imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets to no avail. I understand that a negative value expands the edge while a positive value shrinks it to move it closer to the center. I tried:  but this doesn't display it correctly. I've been tweaking the values but going from say -5 to -10 on the left inset value doesn't appear to move it in expected manner. -10 will scoot the text all the way to the left so I expected -5 to scoot it half way from the left side but it doesn't.  What's the logic behind insets? I'm not familiar with image placements and related terminology. I used this SO question as a reference but something about my values isn't right. UIButton: how to center an image and a text using imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets?
Overview I'm relatively familiar with , not so much with .  I've read through some  vignettes and examples that have popped up on SO, and so far my conclusions are that:   and  are comparable in speed, except when there are many (i.e. >10-100K) groups, and in some other circumstances (see benchmarks below)  has more accessible syntax  abstracts (or will) potential DB interactions There are some minor functionality differences (see "Examples/Usage" below)  In my mind 2. doesn't bear much weight because I am fairly familiar with it , though I understand that for users new to both it will be a big factor.  I would like to avoid an argument about which is more intuitive, as that is irrelevant for my specific question asked from the perspective of someone already familiar with .  I also would like to avoid a discussion about how "more intuitive" leads to faster analysis (certainly true, but again, not what I'm most interested about here). Question What I want to know is:  Are there analytical tasks that are a lot easier to code with one or the other package for people familiar with the packages (i.e. some combination of keystrokes required vs. required level of esotericism, where less of each is a good thing). Are there analytical tasks that are performed substantially (i.e. more than 2x) more efficiently in one package vs. another.  One recent SO question got me thinking about this a bit more, because up until that point I didn't think  would offer much beyond what I can already do in .  Here is the  solution (data at end of Q):  Which was much better than my hack attempt at a  solution.  That said, good  solutions are also pretty good (thanks Jean-Robert, Arun, and note here I favored single statement over the strictly most optimal solution):  The syntax for the latter may seem very esoteric, but it actually is pretty straightforward if you're used to  (i.e. doesn't use some of the more esoteric tricks). Ideally what I'd like to see is some good examples were the  or  way is substantially more concise or performs substantially better. Examples  Usage    does not allow grouped operations that return arbitrary number of rows (from eddi's question, note: this looks like it will be implemented in dplyr 0.5, also, @beginneR shows a potential work-around using  in the answer to @eddi's question).  supports rolling joins (thanks @dholstius) as well as overlap joins  internally optimises expressions of the form  or  for speed through automatic indexing which uses binary search while using the same base R syntax. See here for some more details and a tiny benchmark.  offers standard evaluation versions of functions (e.g. , ) that can simplify the programmatic use of  (note programmatic use of  is definitely possible, just requires some careful though, substitution/quoting, etc, at least to my knowledge)   Benchmarks   I ran my own benchmarks and found both packages to be comparable in "split apply combine" style analysis, except when there are very large numbers of groups (>100K) at which point  becomes substantially faster. @Arun ran some benchmarks on joins, showing that  scales better than  as the number of groups increase (updated with recent enhancements in both packages and recent version of R).  Also, a benchmark when trying to get unique values has  ~6x faster. (Unverified) has  75% faster on larger versions of a group/apply/sort while  was 40% faster on the smaller ones (another SO question from comments, thanks danas). Matt, the main author of , has benchmarked grouping operations on ,  and python  on up to 2 billion rows (~100GB in RAM). An older benchmark on 80K groups has  ~8x faster  Data This is for the first example I showed in the question section.

I have read article at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener but unable to understand  attribute. Definition there is:  If true, useCapture indicates that the user wishes to initiate capture. After initiating capture, all events of the specified type will be dispatched to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTargets beneath it in the DOM tree. Events which are bubbling upward through the tree will not trigger a listener designated to use capture.   In this code parent event triggers before child,so I am not able to understand its  behavior.Document object has usecapture true and child div has usecapture set false and document usecapture is followed.So why document property is preferred over child.

This is all working perfectly, but the virtual keyboard is behaving strange. If I click the , I get the virtual keyboard.  If I click the "Done" button on the virtual keyboard, it goes away.  However, if I click my search button before clicking "Done" on the virtual keyboard, the virtual keyboard stays and I can't get rid of it.  Clicking the "Done" button does not close the keyboard.  It changes the "Done" button from "Done" to an arrow and remains visible. Thanks for your help

The idiom I use the most when programming in Java is to test if  before I use it. This is to avoid a NullPointerException. I find the code very ugly, and it becomes unreadable. Is there a good alternative to this?  I want to address the necessity to test every object if you want to access a field or method of this object.  For example:  In this case I will avoid a , and I don't know exactly if the object is  or not. These tests appear throughout my code as a consequence.
Most OO languages prefix their interface names with a capital I, why does Java not do this?  What was the rationale for not following this convention? To demonstrate what I mean, if I wanted to have a User interface and a User implementation I'd have two choices in Java:   Class = User, Interface = UserInterface Class = UserImpl, Interface = User   Where in most languages:  Class = User, Interface = IUser  Now, you might argue that you could always pick a most descriptive name for the user implementation and the problem goes away, but Java's pushing a POJO approach to things and   most IOC containers use DynamicProxies extensively.  These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation. So, I guess my question boils down to: "Is it worth following the broader Interface naming convention especially in light of where Java Frameworks seem to be heading?"

Reading the Python cookbook at the minute and currently looking at generators. I'm finding it hard to get my head round. As I come from a Java background, is there a Java equivalent? The book was speaking about 'Producer / Consumer', however when I hear that I think of threading. Can anyone explain what a generator is and why you would use it? Without quoting any books, obviously (unless you can find a decent, simplistic answer direct from a book). Perhaps with examples, if you're feeling generous!

I'm testing out an app (hopefully to run on heroku, but am having issues locally as well).  It's giving me an EACCES error when it runs http.Server.listen() - but it only occurs on some ports. So, locally I'm running:  I don't have anything running on port 900 (or any of the other 20 ports I've tried), so this should work.  The weird part is that it does work on some ports.  For instance, port 3000 works perfectly. What would cause this?   Update 1: I figured out that on my local computer, the EACCES error is coming because I have to run node as root in order to bind to those certain ports.  I don't know why this happens, but using sudo fixes it.  However, this doesn't explain how I would fix it on Heroku.  There is no way to run as root on Heroku, so how can I listen on port 80?

After updating Android Studio to 0.2.4 I can't get my project to deploy. There is a complete mismatch of the apk filename.  After reading some posts here, I changed the output path to the build/apk folder, but the issue remains. Instead of the created projectname-debug-unaligned.apk he is looking for the projectname.apk and I have no idea how and where I can tell him to change the name he is looking for. Any ideas? PS: Yes I have read several posts which are shown in the list on the right side. The restart of the IDE worked for my coworker, but not for me. Edit: I stumbled from one issue to the next so I reverted back to the only downloadable version I could find: 0.2.0. No disappearing UI elements, I can create new projects and, best of all, I can finally deploy the APK from the studio to my device again. I will try 0.2.5 as soon as it is released.

This is a very short explanation IMO, and I was wondering if anyone could provide me with what use these tags would be?

I personally like the 'exclusive or' operator when it makes sense in context of boolean checks because of its conciseness.  I much prefer to write  than  but I often get confused looks (from other experienced java developers, not just the newbies), and sometimes comments about how it should only be used for bitwise operations.  I'm curious as to the best practices others use around the '^' operator.
How do I force Python's print function to output to the screen? This is not a duplicate of Disable output buffering - the linked question is attempting unbuffered output, while this is more general. The top answers in that question are too powerful or involved for this one (they're not good answers for this), and this question can be found on Google by a relative newbie.
This has been something that has bothered me for ages now. We are all taught in school (at least, I was) that you MUST free every pointer that is allocated.  I'm a bit curious, though, about the real cost of not freeing memory.  In some obvious cases, like when  is called inside a loop or part of a thread execution, it's very important to free so there are no memory leaks.  But consider the following two examples: First, if I have code that's something like this:  What's the real result here?  My thinking is that the process dies and then the heap space is gone anyway so there's no harm in missing the call to  (however, I do recognize the importance of having it anyway for closure, maintainability, and good practice).  Am I right in this thinking? Second, let's say I have a program that acts a bit like a shell.  Users can declare variables like  and those are stored in some dynamic data structure for later use.  Clearly, it seems obvious that you'd use some solution that will calls some *alloc function (hashmap, linked list, something like that).  For this kind of program, it doesn't make sense to ever free after calling  because these variables must be present at all times during the program's execution and there's no good way (that I can see) to implement this with statically allocated space.  Is it bad design to have a bunch of memory that's allocated but only freed as part of the process ending?  If so, what's the alternative?

I know that this is supposedly a super simple question, but I've been struggling with the concept for some time now.  My question is, how do you chain constructors in c#? I'm in my first OOP class, so I'm just learning.  I don't understand how constructor chaining works or how to implement it, or even why it's better than just doing constructors without chaining.   I would appreciate some examples with an explanation.  So how do how chain them? I know with two it goes:  But how do you do it with three, four and so on? Again, I know this is a beginner question, but I'm struggling to understand this and I don't know why.
I have used unions earlier comfortably; today I was alarmed when I read this post and came to know that this code   is actually undefined behaviour I.e. reading from a member of the union other than the one recently written to leads to undefined behaviour. If this isn't the intended usage of unions, what is? Can some one please explain it elaborately? Update: I wanted to clarify a few things in hindsight.  The answer to the question isn't the same for C and C++; my ignorant younger self tagged it as both C and C++. After scouring through C++11's standard I couldn't conclusively say that it calls out accessing/inspecting a non-active union member is undefined/unspecified/implementation-defined. All I could find was §9.5/1:   If a standard-layout union contains several standard-layout structs that share a common initial sequence, and if an object of this standard-layout union type contains one of the standard-layout structs, it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of standard-layout struct members. §9.2/19: Two standard-layout structs share a common initial sequence if corresponding members have layout-compatible types and either neither member is a bit-field or both are bit-fields with the same width for a sequence of one or more initial members.  While in C, (C99 TC3 - DR 283 onwards) it's legal to do so (thanks to Pascal Cuoq for bringing this up). However, attempting to do it can still lead to undefined behavior, if the value read happens to be invalid (so called "trap representation") for the type it is read through. Otherwise, the value read is implementation defined. C89/90 called this out under unspecified behavior (Annex J) and K&R's book says it's implementation defined. Quote from K&R:  This is the purpose of a union - a single variable that can legitimately hold any of one of several types. [...] so long as the usage is consistent: the type retrieved must be the type most recently stored. It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of which type is currently stored in a union; the results are implementation-dependent if something is stored as one type and extracted as another.  Extract from Stroustrup's TC++PL (emphasis mine)  Use of unions can be essential for compatness of data [...] sometimes misused for "type conversion".   Above all, this question (whose title remains unchanged since my ask) was posed with an intention of understanding the purpose of unions AND not on what the standard allows E.g. Using inheritance for code reuse is, of course, allowed by the C++ standard, but it wasn't the purpose or the original intention of introducing inheritance as a C++ language feature. This is the reason Andrey's answer continues to remain as the accepted one.

I don't know why this question is bugging me, but time after time I come back to the thought - why not make websites in C++? So far I know of none (except a rumor about Yahoo). Most use PHP, Java or ASP.NET. Some are built on Ruby or Python, but even those are minorities. At the same time, looking at StackOverflow, it seems that C++ is still a very popular language with many projects written in it. Why not for webpages? So - what do you know about this subject? Are there any websites written in C++? Are there any frameworks/libraries that help doing this? Have YOU ever done it? If yes, did you run into any fundamental problems and would you recommend this to others?

Like most Python developers, I typically keep a console window open with the Python interpreter running to test commands, dir() stuff, help() stuff, etc. Like any console, after a while the visible backlog of past commands and prints gets to be cluttered, and sometimes confusing when re-running the same command several times.  I'm wondering if, and how, to clear the Python interpreter console. I've heard about doing a system call and either calling  on Windows or  on Linux, but I was hoping there was something I could command the interpreter itself to do. Note: I'm running on Windows, so Ctrl+L doesn't work.

I was working on a new Rails 4 app (on Ruby 2.0.0-p0) when I ran into some authenticity token problems. While writing a controller that responds to json (using the  class method), I got to the  action I started getting  exceptions when I tried to create a record using . I made sure I set  and I set the data with  but still no luck. I tried writing the same controller using Rails 3.2 (on Ruby 1.9.3) and I got no authenticity token problems whatsoever. I searched around and I saw that there were some changes with authenticity tokens in Rails 4. From what I understand, they are no longer automatically inserted in forms anymore? I suppose this is somehow affecting non-HTML content types. Is there any way to get around this without having to request a HTML form, snatching the authenticity token, then making another request with that token? Or am I completely missing something that's completely obvious? Edit: I just tried creating a new record in a new Rails 4 app using a scaffold without changing anything and I'm running into the same problem so I guess it's not something I did.

I'm learning about operator overloading in C++, and I see that  and  are simply some special functions which can be customized for user-defined types. My concern is, though, why are there two separate definitions needed? I thought that if  is true, then  is automatically false, and vice versa, and there is no other possibility, because, by definition,  is . And I couldn't imagine any situation in which this wasn't true. But perhaps my imagination is limited or I am ignorant of something? I know that I can define one in terms of the other, but this is not what I'm asking about. I'm also not asking about the distinction between comparing objects by value or by identity. Or whether two objects could be equal and non-equal at the same time (this is definitely not an option! these things are mutually exclusive). What I'm asking about is this: Is there any situation possible in which asking questions about two objects being equal does make sense, but asking about them not being equal doesn't make sense? (either from the user's perspective, or the implementer's perspective) If there is no such possibility, then why on Earth does C++ have these two operators being defined as two distinct functions?
I am having a hard time trying to get the lodash modules imported. I've setup my project using npm+gulp, and keep hitting the same wall. I've tried the regular lodash, but also lodash-es.

Funny fact, this returns no error:  ... but of course there is no "_" ... My tsconfig.json file:    My gulpfile.js:  If i understand correctly, moduleResolution:'node' in my tsconfig should point the import statements to the node_modules folder, where lodash and lodash-es are installed. I've also tried lots of different ways to import: absolute paths, relative paths, but nothing seems to work. Any ideas?  If necessary i can provide a small zip file to illustrate the problem.

Or is it now the other way around? From what I've heard there are some areas in which C# proves to be faster than C++, but I've never had the guts to test it by myself. Thought any of you could explain these differences in detail or point me to the right place for information on this.

Given integer values  and , C and C++ both return as the quotient  the floor of the floating point equivalent.  I'm interested in a method of returning the ceiling instead.  For example,  and .

First a little background: I have a layout inside a scrollview. At first, when the user scrolls on the screen, the scrollview scrolls. However, after a certain amount of scroll, I was to disable the scroll on the scroll view the move the "scroll focus" onto a webview inside the child layout. This way, the scrollview sticks and all the scroll events go to the webview inside it. So, for a solution, when the scroll threshold is reached, I remove the child layout from the scrollview and put it in scrollview's parent.(And make the scrollview invisible).  General Idea: (-> means contains) Before: parentlayout -> scrollview -> scrollChildLayout After : parentLayout -> scrollChildLayout The above code is giving me this exception:  Do you know what's going on? I am clearly calling removeView on the parent.

MS SQL Server 2000 I feel silly for asking this question, but I've been told that if I foreign key two tables, that SQL Server will create something akin to an index in the child table.  I have a hard time believing this to be true, but can't find much out there related specifically to this. My real reason for asking this is because we're experiencing some very slow response time in a delete statement against a table that has probably 15 related tables.  I've asked our database guy and he says that if there is a foreign key on the fields, then it acts like an index.  What is your experience with this?  Should I add indexes on all foreign key fields or are they just unnecessary overhead?

I am trying to adjust the cell height for one of the cells on my table view. I am adjusting the size from the "row height" setting inside the "size inspector" of the cell in question. When I run the app on my iPhone the cell has the default size set from the "row size" in the table view. If I change the "row size" of the table view then the size of all cells changes. I do not want to do that as I want a custom size only for one cell. I have seen a lot of posts that have a programmatic solution to the problem, but I would prefer to do it through storyboard, if that is possible.
I have a small utility that I use to download a MP3 from a website on a schedule and then builds/updates a podcast XML file which I've obviously added to iTunes.

Perhaps it's the time, perhaps it's me drowning in sparse documentation and not being able to wrap my head around the concept of updating in Mongoose :) Here's the deal:  I have a contact schema and model (shortened properties):  I receive a request from the client, containing the fields I need and use my model thusly:  And now we reach the problem:  If I call  I'll receive an error if the contact with the same phone number already exists (as expected - unique) I can't call  on contact, since that method does not exist on a document If I call update on the model:  I get into an infinite loop of some sorts, since the Mongoose update implementation clearly doesn't want an object as the second parameter. If I do the same, but in the second parameter I pass an associative array of the request properties  it works - but then I have no reference to the specific contact and cannot find out its  and  properties.  So the bottom line, after all I tried: given a document , how do I update it if it exists, or add it if it doesn't? Thanks for your time.

And after that I got the above error Edit: In my case the problem was not  related. It had to do with / configuration, an  file in particular. I realized that after reading this informative post here.

What's the difference between these three terms? My university provides the following definitions: Continuous Integration basically just means that the developer's working copies are synchronized with a shared mainline several times a day. Continuous Delivery is described as the logical evolution of continuous integration: Always be able to put a product into production! Continuous Deployment is described as the logical next step after continuous delivery: Automatically deploy the product into production whenever it passes QA! They also provide a warning: Sometimes the term "Continuous Deployment" is also used if you are able to continuously deploy to the test system. All this leaves me confused. Any explaination that is a little more detailed (or comes with an example) is appreciated!

Is there a command or an existing script that will let me view all of a *NIX system's scheduled cron jobs at once? I'd like it to include all of the user crontabs, as well as , and whatever's in . It would also be nice to see the specific commands run by  in . Ideally, I'd like the output in a nice column form and ordered in some meaningful way. I could then merge these listings from multiple servers to view the overall "schedule of events." I was about to write such a script myself, but if someone's already gone to the trouble...
A feature of C++ is the ability to create unnamed (anonymous) namespaces, like so:  You would think that such a feature would be useless -- since you can't specify the name of the namespace, it's impossible to access anything within it from outside. But these unnamed namespaces are accessible within the file they're created in, as if you had an implicit using-clause to them. My question is, why or when would this be preferable to using static functions? Or are they essentially two ways of doing the exact same thing?
I have found out that setting the PATH environment variable affects only the old command prompt. PowerShell seems to have different environment settings. How do I change the environment variables for PowerShell (v1)? Note: I want to make my changes permanent, so I don't have to set it every time I run PowerShell. Does PowerShell have a profile file? Something like Bash profile on Unix?
I have a SQL Server database of organizations, and there are many duplicate rows.

A statement like:    Will return something like  But I'd also like to grab the IDs of them. Is there any way to do this? Maybe like a   The reason being that there is also a separate table of users that link to these organizations, and I would like to unify them (therefore remove dupes so the users link to the same organization instead of dupe orgs). But I would like part manually so I don't screw anything up, but I would still need a statement returning the IDs of all the dupe orgs so I can go through the list of users.

The problem statement is simple. I need to see if user has selected a radio button from a radio group. Every radio button in the group share same id. The problem is that I don't have control on how the form is generated. Here is the sample code of how a radio button control code looks like:  In addition to this when a radio button is selected it doesn't add a "checked" attribute to the control just text checked (I guess just the property checked without a value). Below is how a selected radio control looks like  Can anybody help me with jQuery code that can help me to get the value of checked radio button?

I might have an array that looks like the following:  Or, really, any sequence of like-typed portions of data. What I want to do is ensure that there is only one of each identical element. For example, the above array would become:  Notice that the duplicates of 2, 6, and 15 were removed to ensure that there was only one of each identical element. Does Swift provide a way to do this easily, or will I have to do it myself?
I have a method that calls 4 other methods in sequence to check for specific conditions, and returns immediately (not checking the following ones) whenever one returns something Truthy.  This seems like a lot of baggage code. Instead of each 2-line if statement, I'd rather do something like:  But that is invalid Python. Am I missing a simple, elegant solution here? Incidentally, in this situation, those four check methods may be expensive, so I do not want to call them multiple times.

Question: is there a simple sh/bash/zsh/fish/... command to print the absolute path of whichever file I feed it? Usage case: I'm in directory  and I'd like to print the full path to file  on the command-line so that I can easily paste it into another program: . Simple, yet a little program to do this could probably save me 5 or so seconds when it comes to handling long paths, which in the end adds up. So it surprises me that I can't find a standard utility to do this — is there really none? Here's a sample implementation, abspath.py:

I am trying to control HTML5 videos using JQuery. I have two clips in a tabbed interface, there are six tabs in total, the others just have images. I am trying to make the video clips play when their tab is clicked and then stop when any of the others are clicked. This must be a simple thing to do but I cant seem to get it to work, the code I am using to play the video is:  I have read that the video element needs to be exposed in a function to be able to control it but can't find an example. I am able to make it work using JS:  Any advice would be great. Thanks

I have my text editor to automatically trim trailing whitespace upon saving a file, and I am contributing to an open source project that has severe problems with trailing whitespace. Every time I try to submit a patch I must first ignore all whitespace-only changes by hand, to choose only the relevant information. Not only that, but when I run  I usually run into several problems because of them. As such I would like to be able to add to index only non-whitespace changes, in a way similar that  does, but without having to pick all the changes myself. Does anyone know how to do this? EDIT: I cannot change the way the project works, and they have decided, after discussing it on the mailing list, to ignore this.

I'm converting an app to use fragments using the compatibility library. Now currently I have a number of activities (A B C D) which chain onto one another, D has a button 'OK' which when pressed calls finish which then bubbles up through onActivityResult to additionally destroy C and B. For my pre Honycomb fragment version each activity is effectively a wrapper on fragments Af Bf Cf Df. All activities are launched via startActivityForResult and onActivityResult within each of the fragments can happily call getActivity().finish The problem that I am having though is in my Honeycomb version I only have one activity, A, and fragments Bf, Cf, Df are loaded using the FragmentManager. What I don't understand is what to do in Df when 'OK' is pressed in order to remove fragments Df, Cf, and Bf?  I tried having the fragment popping itself off the stack but this resulted in an exception. onActivityResult is useless because I have not loaded up the fragment using startActivityForResult. Am I thinking about this completely the wrong way? Should I be implementing some sort of listener that communicates with either the parent fragment or activity in order to do the pop using the transaction manager?
I've created a script that runs every night on my Linux server that uses  to back up each of my MySQL databases to .sql files and packages them together as a compressed .tar file.  The next step I want to accomplish is to send that tar file through email to a remote email server for safekeeping.  I've been able to send the raw script in the body an email by piping the backup text file to  like so:   echoes the backup file's text which is piped into the  program with the recipient's email address passed as an argument. While this accomplishes what I need, I think it could be one step better, Is there any way, using shell scripts or otherwise, to send the compressed .tar file to an outgoing email message as an attachment?  This would beat having to deal with very long email messages which contain header data and often have word-wrapping issues etc.

There are plenty of similar questions to be found on here but I don't think that any answer the question adequately. I'll continue from the current most popular question and use their example if that's alright. The task in this instance is to get the latest post for each author in the database. The example query produces unusable results as its not always the latest post that is returned.  The current accepted answer is   Unfortunately this answer is plain and simple wrong and in many cases produces less stable results than the orginal query.

You can (and should) assume that there is also a wp_posts.id that is a unique identifier for that particular post.

When designing a REST API or service are there any established best practices for dealing with security (Authentication, Authorization, Identity Management) ? When building a SOAP API you have WS-Security as a guide and much literature exists on the topic. I have found less information about securing REST endpoints. While I understand REST intentionally does not have specifications analogous to WS-* I am hoping best practices or recommended patterns have emerged. Any discussion or links to relevant documents would be very much appreciated. If it matters, we would be using WCF with POX/JSON serialized messages for our REST API's/Services built using v3.5 of the .NET Framework.
Is there a way to get the path for the assembly in which the current code resides?  I do not want the path of the calling assembly, just the one containing the code.  Basically my unit test needs to read some xml test files which are located relative to the  dll.  I want the path to always resolve correctly regardless of whether the testing dll is run from TestDriven.NET, the MbUnit GUI or something else. Edit: People seem to be misunderstanding what I'm asking. My test library is located in say   C:\projects\myapplication\daotests\bin\Debug\daotests.dll  and I would like to get this path:  C:\projects\myapplication\daotests\bin\Debug\  The three suggestions so far fail me when I run from the MbUnit Gui:   gives c:\Program Files\MbUnit  gives C:\Documents and Settings\george\Local Settings\Temp\ ....\DaoTests.dll  gives the same as the previous.

I am a big fan of letting the compiler do as much work for you as possible.  When writing a simple class the compiler can give you the following for 'free':  A default (empty) constructor A copy constructor A destructor An assignment operator ()  But it cannot seem to give you any comparison operators - such as  or .  For example:  Is there a good reason for this?  Why would performing a member-by-member comparison be a problem?  Obviously if the class allocates memory then you'd want to be careful, but for a simple class surely the compiler could do this for you?
I keep seeing references to the visitor pattern in blogs but I've got to admit, I just don't get it.  I read the wikipedia article for the pattern and I understand its mechanics but I'm still confused as to when I'd use it.

I'm fairly new to linux and svn. I'm trying to checkout the trunk folder of a project into my public_html directory using this command (while in public_html):  The waterproject directory contains the files from untarring a base install of drupal.

I don't know the command to move all the contents of trunk up to public_html and rm trunk, but I think I could figure that out relatively easily. I just want to know if I can just check out the contents of a folder, without the folder itself.

I really like the ability to edit javascript in the chrome debugger however, I find that it can be really problematic getting the debugger to re-fetch the JavaScript from the server. Sometimes I have to go as far just closing the debugger and reloading the frame works OK - but other times (an dI cannot pin down under what conditions this occurs) I have to clear my temporary internet cache.  Sometimes I swear I have to close chrome completely, then clear the cache and then load the page before the debugger finally shows me the most up-to-date script. (NB.  There is no caching of the script by the web server) I was wondering if anyone knew of a quick and easy way to tell the debugger to invalidate all its javascript and fetch it all anew on page reload?

The Question How to find time complexity of an algorithm? What have I done before posting a question on SO ? I have gone through this, this and many other links But no where I was able to find a clear and straight forward explanation for how to calculate time complexity. What do I know ? Say for a code as simple as the one below:  Say for a loop like the one below:   int i=0; This will be executed only once. The time is actually calculated to  and not the declaration. i < N;  This will be executed N+1 times i++ ;   This will be executed N times So the number of operations required by this loop are {1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2 Note: This still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding on calculating time complexity What I want to know ? Ok, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as  O(N), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!).... and many other,  Can anyone help me understand how does one calculate time complexity of an algorithm? I am sure there are plenty of newbies like me wanting to know this.

It's quite annoying to test all my strings for  before I can safely apply methods like ,  etc... If the default value of  were the empty string, I would not have to test, and I would feel it to be more consistent with the other value types like  or  for example. Additionally  would make sense. So why did the designers of C# choose to use  as the default value of strings? Note: This relates to this question, but is more focused on the why instead of what to do with it.

I have been working on a method to sync core data stored in an iPhone application between multiple devices, such as an iPad or a Mac. There are not many (if any at all) sync frameworks for use with Core Data on iOS. However, I have been thinking about the following concept:  A change is made to the local core data store, and the change is saved. (a) If the device is online, it tries to send the changeset to the server, including the device ID of the device which sent the changeset. (b) If the changeset does not reach the server, or if the device is not online, the app will add the change set to a queue to send when it does come online. The server, sitting in the cloud, merges the specific change sets it receives with its master database. After a change set (or a queue of change sets) is merged on the cloud server, the server pushes all of those change sets to the other devices registered with the server using some sort of polling system. (I thought to use Apple's Push services, but apparently according to the comments this is not a workable system.)  Is there anything fancy that I need to be thinking about? I have looked at REST frameworks such as ObjectiveResource, Core Resource, and RestfulCoreData. Of course, these are all working with Ruby on Rails, which I am not tied to, but it's a place to start. The main requirements I have for my solution are:  Any changes should be sent in the background without pausing the main thread. It should use as little bandwidth as possible.  I have thought about a number of the challenges:  Making sure that the object IDs for the different data stores on different devices are attached on the server. That is to say, I will have a table of object IDs and device IDs, which are tied via a reference to the object stored in the database. I will have a record (DatabaseId [unique to this table], ObjectId [unique to the item in the whole database], Datafield1, Datafield2), the ObjectId field will reference another table, AllObjects: (ObjectId, DeviceId, DeviceObjectId). Then, when the device pushes up a change set, it will pass along the device Id and the objectId from the core data object in the local data store. Then my cloud server will check against the objectId and device Id in the AllObjects table, and find the record to change in the initial table. All changes should be timestamped, so that they can be merged. The device will have to poll the server, without using up too much battery. The local devices will also need to update anything held in memory if/when changes are received from the server.  Is there anything else I am missing here? What kinds of frameworks should I look at to make this possible?

I've been Googling and searching Stack Overflow for a while, but I just can't get around this problem. I have a standard HTML table, containing, say, fruit. Like so:  Above this I have a text box, which I would like to search the table as a user types. So, if they type  for example, the Orange row of the table would disapear, leaving the Apple and Grapes. If they carried on and typed  the Apple row should disapear, leaving just grapes. I hope this is clear. And, should the user delete some or all of their query from the text box, I should like all of the rows that now match the query to reappear. While I know how to remove a table row in jQuery, I have little idea about how to go about doing the search and removing rows selectively based on this. Is there a simple solution to this? Or a plugin? If anyone could point me in the right direction it would be brilliant. Thank you.
I am so close to getting this, but it just isn't right.  All I would like to do is remove the character "r" from a string.  The problem is, there is more than one instance of "r" in the string. However, it is always the 4th character. example string: "crt/r2002_2" What I want: "crt/2002_2" This replace function removes both "r"  Produces: "ct/2002_2" I tried this function:  It only works if I replace it with another character. It will not simply remove it. Any thoughts?

I'm building an iOS app using a Storyboard. The root view controller is a Tab Bar Controller. I'm creating the login/logout process, and it's mostly working fine, but I've got a few issues. I need to know the BEST way to set all this up. I want to accomplish the following:  Show a login screen the first time the app is launched. When they login, go to the first tab of the Tab Bar Controller. Any time they launch the app after that, check if they are logged in, and skip straight to the first tab of the root Tab Bar Controller. When they manually click a logout button, show the login screen, and clear all the data from the view controllers.  What I've done so far is set the root view controller to the Tab Bar Controller, and created a custom segue to my Login view controller. Inside my Tab Bar Controller class, I check whether they are logged in inside the  method, and a perform the segue:   I also setup a notification for when the logout action needs to be performed:  Upon logout, I clear the credentials from the Keychain, run  and perform the segue to show the login view controller again. This all works fine, but I'm wondering: should this logic be in the AppDelegate? I also have two issues:  The first time they launch the app, the Tab Bar Controller shows briefly before the segue is performed. I've tried moving the code to  but the segue will not work that early. When they logout, all the data is still inside all the view controllers. If they login to a new account, the old account data is still displayed until they refresh. I need a way to clear this easily on logout.  I'm open to reworking this. I've considered making the login screen the root view controller, or creating a navigation controller in the AppDelegate to handle everything... I'm just not sure what the best method is at this point.

I know references are syntactic sugar, so code is easier to read and write. But what are the differences?  Summary from answers and links below:  A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference cannot be re-seated after binding. Pointers can point nowhere (), whereas reference always refer to an object. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers. There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in ).  To clarify a misconception:  The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must   implement references, but every C++ compiler implements   references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as:  if it's not optimized away entirely, allocates the same amount of storage   as a pointer, and places the address   of  into that storage.  So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory. As a general rule,  Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces. Use pointers to implement algorithms and data structures.  Interesting read:  My all-time favorite C++ FAQ lite. References vs. Pointers. An Introduction to References. References and const.

Once again I was in a design review, and encountered the claim that the probability of a particular scenario was "less than the risk of cosmic rays" affecting the program, and it occurred to me that I didn't have the faintest idea what that probability is.  "Since 2-128 is 1 out of 340282366920938463463374607431768211456, I think we're justified in taking our chances here, even if these computations are off by a factor of a few billion...  We're way more at risk for cosmic rays to screw us up, I believe."  Is this programmer correct? What is the probability of a cosmic ray hitting a computer and affecting the execution of the program?

I'm really having a hard time understanding the difference between procedural and functional programming paradigms. Here are the first two paragraphs from the Wikipedia entry on functional programming:  In computer science, functional   programming is a programming paradigm   that treats computation as the   evaluation of mathematical functions   and avoids state and mutable data. It   emphasizes the application of   functions, in contrast to the   imperative programming style, which   emphasizes changes in state.   Functional programming has its roots   in lambda calculus, a formal system   developed in the 1930s to investigate   function definition, function   application, and recursion. Many   functional programming languages can   be viewed as elaborations on the   lambda calculus. In practice, the difference between a   mathematical function and the notion   of a "function" used in imperative   programming is that imperative   functions can have side effects,   changing the value of program state.   Because of this they lack referential   transparency, i.e. the same language   expression can result in different   values at different times depending on   the state of the executing program.   Conversely, in functional code, the   output value of a function depends   only on the arguments that are input   to the function, so calling a function    twice with the same value for an   argument  will produce the same   result  both times. Eliminating   side effects can make it much easier   to understand and predict the behavior   of a program, which is one of the key   motivations for the development of   functional programming.  In paragraph 2 where it says  Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function  twice with the same value for an argument  will produce the same result  both times.  Isn't that the same exact case for procedural programming? What should one look for in procedural vs functional that stand out?

Okay, I have a page on and on this page I have an iframe.  What I need to do is on the iframe page, find out what the URL of the main page is.  I have searched around and I know that this is not possible if my iframe page is on a different domain, as that is cross-site scripting. But everywhere I've read says that if the iframe page is on the same domain as the parent page, it should work if I do for instance:     ... or other similar combos, as there seems to be multiple ways to get the same info.  Anyways, so here's the problem.  My iframe is on the same domain as the main page, but it is not on the same SUB domain.  So for instance I have  http:// www.mysite.com/pageA.html  and then my iframe URL is   http:// qa-www.mysite.com/pageB.html  When I try to grab the URL from  (the iframe page), I keep getting the same access denied error.  So it appears that even sub-domains count as cross-site scripting, is that correct, or am I doing something wrong?

I'm working on a projects which involves a lot of database writes, I'd say (70% inserts and 30% reads).  This ratio would also include updates which I consider to be one read and one write.  The reads can be dirty (e.g. I don't need 100% accurate information at the time of read). The task in question will be doing over 1 million database transactions an hour.   I've read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB, and MyISAM seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database/tables that I'll be using for this task.  From what I seem to be reading, InnoDB is good if transactions are needed since row level locking is supported. Does anybody have any experience with this type of load (or higher)?  Is MyISAM the way to go?

A common task when calling web resources from a code is building a query string to including all the necessary parameters. While by all means no rocket science, there are some nifty details you need to take care of like, appending an  if not the first parameter, encoding the parameters etc. The code to do it is very simple, but a bit tedious:  This is such a common task one would expect a utility class to exist that makes it more elegant and readable.

I just upgraded my MacMini Server from Lion Server to Mountain Lion using OS X Server.  I am having the same problem with PostgreSQL that I did last year when I first installed Lion Server. When I try to do any kind of PostgreSQL terminal command I get the following notorious error message that many have gotten over the years:  I was attempting to change the password for _postgres when I got the error.  I tried several commands but got the same error.  I just rebooted my server but no luck.  I logged in as root to look at /var/pgsql_socket and the folder is empty.  Folder /var/pgsql_socket_alt is also empty. I have checked online about this.  However just about all of the solutions I have read, including on Stack Overflow, suggest a removal and reinstall of PostgreSQL.  I do not know but this does not seem like a plausible option because several options on the Server App use PostgreSQL.  I contacted Apple Enterprise Support (no agreement) and I was told that my issue would have to be solved by the developers which would cast $695. I have a website that is down right now because I cannot rebuild it.  I don't know where to turn for help with this at this point.  I will continue looking online to see if I can find something.  However I hope that someone can give me an answer quick so I can rebuild my database.

I have a Twitter Bootstrap dropdown menu. As all Twitter Bootstrap users know, the dropdown menu closes on click (even clicking inside it). To avoid this, I can easily attach a click event handler on the dropdown menu and simply add the famous .   This looks easy and a very common behavior, however, and since  (as well as ) event handlers are delegated to the  object, the  event on these elements (prev/next controls, ...) will be “ignored”.  Relying on Twitter Bootstrap dropdown / events is not a solution for the following reasons:  The provided event for both event handlers doesn’t give you reference to the clicked element The dropdown menu content is dynamically generated so adding a  class is not possible  This fiddle is the normal behavior and this fiddle is with  added.

We're using git submodules to manage a couple of large projects that have dependencies on many other libraries we've developed. Each library is a separate repo brought into the dependant project as a submodule. During development, we often want to just go grab the latest version of every dependant submodule. Does git have a built in command to do this?  If not, how about a Windows batch file or similar that can do it?
I've built a basic app in Angular, but I have encountered a strange issue where I cannot inject a service into one of my components. It injects fine into any of the three other components I have created however. For starters, this is the service:  And the component that it refuses to work with:  The error I get in the browser console is this:  EXCEPTION: Can't resolve all parameters for HeaderComponent: (?).  I have the service in the bootstrap function so it has a provider. And I seem to be able to inject it into the constructor of any of my other components without issue.

In Visual Studio, we've all had "baadf00d", have seen seen "CC" and "CD" when inspecting variables in the debugger in C++ during run-time. From what I understand, "CC" is in DEBUG mode only to indicate when a memory has been new() or alloc() and unitilialized.  While "CD" represents delete'd or free'd memory.  I've only seen "baadf00d" in RELEASE build (but I may be wrong). Once in a while, we get into a situation of tacking memory leaks, buffer overflows, etc and these kind of information comes in handy. Would somebody be kind enough to point out when and in what modes the memory are set to recognizable byte patterns for debugging purpose?

I have a  with a  and I want the input data be saved always with the FIRST LETTER IN CAPITAL. Example:  How can I achieve this maximizing performance?  NOTE: Based on the answers and the comments under the answers, many people think this is asking about capitalizing all words in the string. E.g.  It isn't, but if that is what you seek, look for one of the answers that uses 's  method. (NOTE: Those answers are incorrect for the question actually asked.) See TextInfo.ToTitleCase doc for caveats (doesn't touch all-caps words - they are considered acronyms; may lowercase letters in middle of words that "shouldn't" be lowered, e.g. "McDonald" => "Mcdonald"; not guaranteed to handle all culture-specific subtleties re capitalization rules.)  NOTE: The question is ambiguous as to whether letters after the first should be forced to lower case.  The accepted answer assumes that only the first letter should be altered. If you want to force all letters in the string except the first to be lower case, look for an answer containing , and not containing ToTitleCase.

I read some articles about the XML parsers and came across SAX and DOM. SAX is event-based and DOM is tree model -- I don't understand the differences between these concepts.  From what I have understood, event-based means some kind of event happens to the node. Like when one clicks a particular node it will give all the sub nodes rather than loading all the nodes at the same time. But in the case of DOM parsing it will load all the nodes and make the tree model.  Is my understanding correct?  Please correct me If I am wrong or explain to me event-based and tree model in a simpler manner.

So, I'm playing with decorators in Python 2.6, and I'm having some trouble getting them to work. Here is my class file:  What I thought this meant is to treat  like a property, but call these functions on get and set. So, I fired up IDLE and checked it:  Clearly the first call works as expected, since I call the getter, and there is no default value, and it fails. OK, good, I understand. However, the call to assign  seems to create a new property , and now the getter doesn't work! What am I missing?

Well, I've tried to understand and read what could cause it but I just can't get it: I have somewhere in my code this:  Thing is that, when it tries to invoke some method it throws   instead of some other expected exception (specifically ).  As I actually know what method is invoked I went straight to this method code and added a try-catch block for the line that suppose to throw   and it really threw  as expected. Yet when going up it  somehow changes to  and in the code above    e is  and not   as expected. What could cause such a behavior or how can I check such a thing?
I have some code in a header that looks like this:  If I include this header in a cpp that does not include the  type definition, then this does not compile under VS2010-SP1:  1>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft   Visual Studio   10.0\VC\include\memory(2067): error C2027: use of undefined type 'Thing'  Replace  by  and it compiles. So, I'm guessing that it's the current VS2010 's implementation that requires the full definition and it's totally implementation-dependant. Or is it? Is there something in it's standard requirements that makes impossible for 's implementation to work with a forward declaration only? It feels strange as it should only hold a pointer to , shouldn't it?

I'm trying to install libraries via NPM so that I can work on a project. I tried using BREW to update before NVM, using "brew update" and "brew install node".  I've tried deleting the "node" directory in my /usr/local/include and the "node" and "node_modules" in my "/usr/local/lib". I've tried uninstalling npm and reinstalling it following these instructions. All of this because I was trying to update an older version of node to install the "zipstream" library. Now there's folders in my users directory, and the node version STILL isn't up to date, even though NVM says it's using 0.6.19. Ideally, I'd like to uninstall nodejs, npm, and nvm, and just reinstall the entire thing from scratch on my system.

I tried using the following jQuery code:  When I try this in Firefox everything gets disabled but the form is not submitted with any of the POST data it is supposed to include. I can't use jQuery to submit the form because I need the button to be submitted with the form as there are multiple submit buttons and I determine which was used by which one's value is included in the POST. I need the form to be submitted as it usually is and I need to disable everything right after that happens. Thanks!
Most of the tutorials that I've read on arrays in JavaScript (including w3schools and devguru) suggest that you can initialize an array with a certain length by passing an integer to the Array constructor using the  syntax. After using this syntax liberally in my js files, I ran one of the files through jsLint, and it freaked out:  Error: Problem at line 1 character 22: Expected ')' and instead saw '4'.   var test = new Array(4);   Problem at line 1 character 23: Expected ';' and instead saw ')'.   var test = new Array(4);   Problem at line 1 character 23: Expected an identifier and instead saw ')'.  After reading through jsLint's explanation of its behavior, it looks like jsLint doesn't really like the  syntax, and instead prefers  when declaring arrays. So I have a couple questions.  First, why?  Am I running any risk by using the  syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?  And second, if I switch to the square bracket syntax, is there any way to declare an array and set its length all on one line, or do I have to do something like this:
I have a number of projects built using CMake and I'd like to be able to easily switch between using GCC or Clang/LLVM to compile them. I believe (please correct me if I'm mistaken!) that to use Clang I need to set the following:  Is there an easy way of switching between these and the default GCC variables, preferably as a system-wide change rather than project specific (i.e. not just adding them into a project's CMakeLists.txt)? Also, is it necessary to use the  programs rather than the system defaults when compiling using clang instead of gcc? What's the difference?
I just bombed an interview and made pretty much zero progress on my interview question. Can anyone let me know how to do this? I tried searching online but couldn't find anything:  Given a number, find the next higher number which has the exact same   set of digits as the original number. For example: given 38276 return   38627  I wanted to begin by finding the index of the first digit (from the right) that was less than the ones digit. Then I would rotate the last digits in the subset such that it was the next biggest number comprised of the same digits, but got stuck. The interviewer also suggested trying to swap digits one at a time, but I couldn't figure out the algorithm and just stared at a screen for like 20-30 minutes. Needless to say, I think I'm going to have to continue the job hunt. edit: for what its worth, I was invited to the next round of interviews

I was wondering if there is any API in the Collection framework that returns the number of  occurrences or if there is another way to determine the number of occurrences. I found that Google's Collection  does have an API that returns the total number of occurrences of an element. But that is compatible only with JDK 1.5. Our product is currently in JDK 1.6, so I cannot use it.

With the iPhone SDK: I have a  with  that brings up a keyboard.  I need it to be able to:  Allow scrolling of the contents of the  to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up Automatically "jump" (by scrolling up) or shortening  I know that I need a .  I've tried changing the class of my  to a  but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.   Do I need both a UIView and a ?  Does one go inside the other? [EDIT: I now know that you want a  inside of a , and the trick is to programatically set the content size of the  to the frame size of the .] Then what needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field? Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder.  I'd like to only write code for what needs it. Note: the  (or ) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (), which needs to function as normal.  Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.   I've got it working where I change the frame size of the  when the keyboard goes up and down.  I'm simply using:   However this doesn't automatically "move up" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.

I've used recursion quite a lot on my many years of programming to solve simple problems, but I'm fully aware that sometimes you need iteration due to memory/speed problems. So, sometime in the very far past I went to try and find if there existed any "pattern" or text-book way of transforming a common recursion approach to iteration and found nothing. Or at least nothing that I can remember it would help.  Are there general rules? Is there a "pattern"?

Assuming I am the maintainer of a repo, and I want to pull in changes from a contributor, there are a few possible workflows:  I  each commit from the remote (in order). In this case git records the commit as unrelated to the remote branch. I  the branch, pulling in all changes, and adding a new "conflict" commit (if needed). I  each commit from the remote branch individually (again in order), allowing conflicts to be recorded for each commit, instead of grouped all together as one.  For completeness, you could do a  (same as  option?), however my understanding is that this can cause confusion for the contributor. Maybe that eliminates option 1.  In both cases 2 and 3, git records the branch history of the commits, unlike 1. What are the pro's and con's between using either  or  methods described? My understanding is that method 2 is the norm, but I feel that resolving a large commit with a single "conflict" merge, is not the cleanest solution.

I have done some web based projects, but I don't think too much about the load and execution sequence of an ordinary web page. But now I need to know detail. It's hard to find answers from Google or SO, so I created this question. A sample page is like this:  So here are my questions:  How does this page load? What is the sequence of the loading? When is the JS code executed? (inline and external) When is the CSS executed (applied)? When does $(document).ready get executed? Will abc.jpg be downloaded? Or does it just download kkk.png?  I have the following understanding:  The browser loads the html (DOM) at first. The browser starts to load the external resources from top to bottom, line by line. If a  is met, the loading will be blocked and wait until the JS file is loaded and executed and then continue. Other resources (CSS/images) are loaded in parallel and executed if needed (like CSS).  Or is it like this: The browser parses the html (DOM) and gets the external resources in an array or stack-like structure. After the html is loaded, the browser starts to load the external resources in the structure in parallel and execute, until all resources are loaded. Then the DOM will be changed corresponding to the user's behaviors depending on the JS. Can anyone give a detailed explanation about what happens when you've got the response of a html page? Does this vary in different browsers? Any reference about this question? Thanks. EDIT: I did an experiment in Firefox with Firebug. And it shows as the following image:

Most of the tutorials that I've read on arrays in JavaScript (including w3schools and devguru) suggest that you can initialize an array with a certain length by passing an integer to the Array constructor using the  syntax. After using this syntax liberally in my js files, I ran one of the files through jsLint, and it freaked out:  Error: Problem at line 1 character 22: Expected ')' and instead saw '4'.   var test = new Array(4);   Problem at line 1 character 23: Expected ';' and instead saw ')'.   var test = new Array(4);   Problem at line 1 character 23: Expected an identifier and instead saw ')'.  After reading through jsLint's explanation of its behavior, it looks like jsLint doesn't really like the  syntax, and instead prefers  when declaring arrays. So I have a couple questions.  First, why?  Am I running any risk by using the  syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?  And second, if I switch to the square bracket syntax, is there any way to declare an array and set its length all on one line, or do I have to do something like this:

I would like to be able to improve on these central repos, either directly in their original location, or from within their embedding repos (the ones that use them via submodule).     From within these submodules, can I create branches/modifications and use push/pull just like I would in regular repos, or are there things to be cautious about?   How would I advance the submodule referenced commit from say (tagged) 1.0 to 1.1 (even though the head of the original repo is already at 2.0), or pick which branch's commit is used at all?

So I have difficulty with the concept of *args and **kwargs. So far I have learned that:   = list of arguments - as positional arguments  = dictionary - whose keys become separate keyword arguments and the values become values of these arguments.  ?? To be honest I don't understand what programming task this would be helpful for.  Maybe: I think to enter lists and dictionaries as arguments of a function AND at the same time as a wildcard, so I can pass ANY argument? Is there a simple example to explain how  and  are used? Also the tutorial I found used just the "*" and a variable name.  Is  and  just a placeholder or do you use exactly  and  in the code?

I am trying to add a drop shadow to views that are layered on top of one another, the views collapse allowing content in other views to be seen, in this vein i want to keep  ON so that when the views collapse their content is clipped. This seems to have made it difficult for me to add a drop shadow to the layers as when i turn  ON the shadows are clipped also. I have been trying to manipulate  and  in order to add a drop shadow to the frame but allow the bounds to be large enough to encompass it, however I have had no luck with this. Here is the code I am using to add a Shadow (this only works with  OFF as shown)  Here is a screenshot of the shadow being applied to the top lightest grey layer. Hopefully this gives an idea of how my content will overlap if  is OFF.  How can I add a shadow to my  and keep my content clipped? Edit: Just wanted to add that I have also played around with using background images with shadows on, which does work well, however I would still like to know the best coded solution for this.
Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results. If additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel.  If one iterable is shorter than another it is assumed to be extended with None items.  If function is , the identity function is assumed; if there are multiple arguments,  returns a list consisting of tuples containing the corresponding items from all iterables (a kind of transpose operation).  The iterable arguments may be a sequence or any iterable object; the result is always a list. What role does this play in making a Cartesian product?  What effect does putting a tuple anywhere in there have? I also noticed that without the map function the output is  and with it, it's . I want to fully understand this function. The reference definitions is also hard to understand. Too much fancy fluff.

The switch widget introduced in API 14 is styled by default with holo theme. I want to style it slightly different, changing its colors and shape a bit for branding reasons. How does one go about this? I know it must be possible, as ive seen the difference between default ICS and Samsung's touchwiz theme   I assume I'll need some state drawables, and I've seen a few styles in http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable.html with Switch_thumb and Switch_track that look like what I might be after. I just don't know how to go about using them. I'm using ActionbarSherlock if that makes a difference. Only devices running API v14 or above will be able to use a switch at all, of course.

There are a lot of questions here related to Bootstrap. I see a lot of people using it. So I tried to research it, and I found the official Bootstrap site, but there was only a download section and a few words after that. Nothing that explains what is it for... I just understood that it is a front-end helper. I have tried to find something by Googling, but found nothing specific. Everything I found is related to the computer science definition.  So, my questions are:   What is Bootstrap at all? What is it used for, and how does it help front-end development? I would also like some more details explaining it.

Now I would like to migrate my ObjC framework to Swift and I got the following error:  The references is to a header file which just define a protocol and I use this header file in some classes to use this protocol. Is seems related to the module feature but it is at the moment not quite clear how to fix, do you know a solution? UPDATE: This is a Swift compiler error. UPDATE 2: A quick fix (but not solving the root cause) is to set the following setting to yes: CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES = YES

I created a sample project, with C#6.0 goodies - null propagation and properties initialization as an example, set target version .NET 4.0 and it... works.   Wikipedia says .NET framework for C# 6.0 is 4.6. This question (and Visual Studio 2015 CTP test) says CLR version is 4.0.30319.0. This MSDN page says that .NET 4, 4.5, 4.5.2 uses CLR 4. There isn't any information about .NET 4.6.  Does it mean that I can use C# 6.0 features for my software that targets .NET 4.0? Are there any limitations or drawbacks?

Is my only option to use a vector of pointers instead?
I've recently used our company's spare laptop (that has a general user set up) while mine was being repaired.

I am using python 3.1, on a windows 7 machines. Russian is the default system language, and utf-8 is the default encoding. Looking at the answer to a previous question, I have attempting using the "codecs" module to give me a little luck. Here's a few examples:  My last idea was, I thought it might have been the fact that windows "translates" a few folders, such as the "users" folder, into Russian (though typing "users" is still the correct path), so I tried it in the Python31 folder. Still, no luck. Any ideas?

I have some confusion related to the .NET platform build options in Visual Studio 2008. What is the "Any CPU" compilation target, and what sort of files does it generate? I examined the output executable of this "Any CPU" build and found that they are the x86 executables (who would not see that coming!). So, is there any the difference between targeting executable to x86 vs "Any CPU"? Another thing that I noticed, is that managed C++ projects do not have this platform as an option. Why is that? Does that mean that my suspicion about "Any CPU" executables being plain 32-bit ones is right?

I'm running a curl request on an eXist database through php. The dataset is very large, and as a result, the database consistently takes a long amount of time to return an XML response. To fix that, we set up a curl request, with what is supposed to be a long timeout.  However, the curl request consistently ends before the request is completed (<1000 when requested via a browser). Does anyone know if this is the proper way to set timeouts in curl?
I have only one branch. For a few months I have been using  to commit to my local repository. Last night after I made some minor changes to my local repository and tried to push using the same command, I got this error:  I googled and found questions such as this one and this one, but none of the answers to these questions solves my problem. Most of the answers suggest the problem of detached head. Yet I don't think my head is detached. Nor do I think I am on the wrong branch (as I only have one branch...) I did a few experiments to figure out what's wrong, and here are the results I got: (1) First comes my  output    (2) When I type , I can see all my local commits, but the remote repository just won't get updated.

I've read a few pages about Hot Module Replacement in Webpack. There's even a sample app that uses it. I've read all of this and still don't get the idea.   What can I do with it? Is it supposed to only be used in development and not in production? Is it like LiveReload, but you have to manage it yourself? Is WebpackDevServer integrated with it in some way? Suppose I want to update my CSS (one stylesheet) and JS modules when I save them to disk, without reloading the page and without using plugins such as LiveReload. Is this something Hot Module Replacement can help me with? What kind of work do I need to do, and what does HMR already provide?

I have a list with 15 numbers in, and I need to write some code that produces all 32,768 combinations of those numbers.  I've found some code (by Googling) that apparently does what I'm looking for, but I found the code fairly opaque and am wary of using it. Plus I have a feeling there must be a more elegant solution. The only thing that occurs to me would be to just loop through the decimal integers 1–32768 and convert those to binary, and use the binary representation as a filter to pick out the appropriate numbers.  Does anyone know of a better way? Using , maybe?
Any idea why the piece of code below does not add the script element to the DOM?
I've asked before about how to squash the first two commits in a git repository. While the solutions are rather interesting and not really as mind-warping as some other things in git, they're still a bit of the proverbial bag of hurt if you need to repeat the procedure many times along the development of your project.  So, I'd rather go through pain only once, and then be able to forever use the standard interactive rebase.  What I want to do, then, is to have an empty initial commit that exists solely for the purpose of being the first. No code, no nothing. Just taking up space so it can be the base for rebase. My question then is, having an existing repository, how do I go about inserting a new, empty commit before the first one, and shifting everyone else forward?

Here's the code I have so far:  Will somebody please point me in the right direction like a property to set or a function to call that will change the opacity?

How can I detect the page zoom level in all modern browsers? While this thread tells how to do it in IE7 and IE8, I can't find a good cross-browser solution. Firefox stores the page zoom level for future access. On the first page load, would I be able to get the zoom level? Somewhere I read it works when a zoom change occurs after the page is loaded. Is there a way to trap the  event?  I need this because some of my calculations are pixel-based and they may fluctuate when zoomed.  Modified sample given by @tfl This page alerts different height values when zoomed. [jsFiddle]
I have a group of buttons that should act like toggle buttons, but also as radio buttons where only one button can be selected / pressed down at a current time. It also need to have a state where none of the buttons are selected / pressed down. The behavior will be kind of like Photoshop toolbar, where zero or one of the tools are selected at any time! Any idea how this can be implemented in WPF?

I want to rename the folders to match the new solution name, but I can't figure out a way to refactor the folder names automatically, and going through every single project file will be painful. Is there an official way to do this? Alternatively (and much less preferably), are there free tools to accomplish this?
When I try opening Eclipse, a pop-up dialog states:  Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:/JDK/bin/client/jvm.dll"`.  Following this, Eclipse force closes. Here's a few points I'd like to make:    I checked to see if anything exists at that path. It does exist.   My Eclipse and Java SE Development Kit are both 64-bit. I checked my system, and it can handle 64-bit.   I've searched for this problem on Google and on Stack Overflow, and the only answer I found was to download the 32-bit versions of JDK and Eclipse.  Downloading the 32-bit versions is something I only want to do as a very last resort. What would be suggested to solve this issue?

What is the recommended way to zerofill a value in JavaScript? I imagine I could build a custom function to pad zeros on to a typecasted value, but I'm wondering if there is a more direct way to do this? Note: By "zerofilled" I mean it in the database sense of the word (where a 6-digit zerofilled representation of the number 5 would be "000005").
I want to perform my own complex operations on financial data in dataframes in a sequential manner. For example I am using the following MSFT CSV file taken from Yahoo Finance:  I then do the following:  Is that the most efficient way? Given the focus on speed in pandas, I would assume there must be some special function to iterate through the  values in a manner that one also retrieves the index (possibly through a generator to be memory efficient)?  unfortunately only iterates column by column.

According to this: http://developer.android.com/preview/features/runtime-permissions.html#coding an app can check for runtime permissions and request permissions if it hasn't been granted already. The following dialog will be displayed then:  In case the user declines an important permission, imo an app should display an explanation why the permission is needed and what impact declining has. That dialog has two options: 1) re-try again (permission is requested again), 2) deny (app will work without that permission). If the user checks "Never ask again" however, the second dialog with the explanation shouldn't be shown, especially if the user already declined once before. Now the question is: how does my app know whether the user has checked the "Never ask again"? IMO the onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) doesn't give me that information. A second question would be: does Google have plans to incorporate a custom message in the permission dialog that would explain why the app needs the permission? That way there would never be a second dialog which would certainly make for a better ux.

I'm asking more about what this means to my code.  I understand the concepts mathematically, I just have a hard time wrapping my head around what they mean conceptually.  For example, if one were to perform an O(1) operation on a data structure, I understand that the amount of operations it has to perform won't grow because there are more items.  And an O(n) operation would mean that you would perform a set of operations on each element.  Could somebody fill in the blanks here?  Like what exactly would an O(n^2) operation do? And what the heck does it mean if an operation is O(n log(n))? And does somebody have to smoke crack to write an O(x!)?

What is the difference between concurrent programming and parallel programing? I asked google but didn't find anything that helped me to understand that difference. Could you give me an example for both? For now I found this explanation: http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7411 - but "concurrency is a property of the program" vs "parallel execution is a property of the machine" isn't enough for me - still I can't say what is what.
When I was studying for my undergraduate degree in EE, MATLAB required each function to be defined in its own file, even if it was a one-liner. I'm studying for a graduate degree now, and I have to write a project in MATLAB. Is this still a requirement for newer versions of MATLAB? If it is possible to put more than one function in a file, are there any restrictions to this? For instance, can all the functions in the file be accessed from outside the file, or only the function that has the same name as the file? Note: I am using MATLAB release R2007b.

C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming? This article (by Gavin Clarke who quotes Herb Sutter) says that,  The memory model means that C++ code   now has a standardized library to call   regardless of who made the compiler   and on what platform it's running.   There's a standard way to control how   different threads talk to the   processor's memory. "When you are talking about splitting   [code] across different cores that's   in the standard, we are talking about   the memory model. We are going to   optimize it without breaking the   following assumptions people are going   to make in the code," Sutter said.  Well, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this. So, what I basically want to know is, C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details. I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related? As I don't know how internals of multi-threading works, and what memory model means in general, please help me understand these concepts. :-)

A while ago I started coding a new ios app, after a long break from it, I'm working on it again and have it almost complete. I test it on the simulator but when I tried to install it on my iphone 6 (something I have already done in the past) I got an error telling me that my app cannot be installed since the certificate that was used to sign this app expired or has been revoked. I tried many things:  I deleted all certificates and provisioninig profiles from xcode, keychain and apple developer and let xcode create me new ones I deleted xcode and did the whole proccess from the begining  But this didn't fix my issue. Any idea what might be the problem?

I have two collections which have property  in both collections. I need to get a list of the items in the first list where  does not exist in the second list. With SQL I would just use "not in", but I do not know the equivalent in LINQ. How is that done? So far I have a join, like...  But I cannot join since I need the difference and the join would fail. I need some way of using Contains or Exists I believe. I just have not found an example to do that yet.
Should a method that implements an interface method be annotated with ? The javadoc of the  annotation says:   Indicates that a method declaration is intended to override a method declaration in a superclass. If a method is annotated with this annotation type but does not override a superclass method, compilers are required to generate an error message.  I don't think that an interface is technically a superclass. Or is it? Question Elaboration

I have an (XHTML Strict) page where I float an image alongside regular paragraphs of text. All goes well, except when a list is used instead of paragraphs. The bullets of the list overlap the floated image. Changing the margin of the list or the list items does not help. The margin is calculated from the left of the page, but the float pushes the list items to the right inside the  itself. So the margin only helps if I make it wider than the image. Floating the list next to the image also works, but I don't know when the list is next to a float. I don't want to float every list in my content just to fix this. Also, floating left messes up the layout when an image is floated to the right instead of left of the list. Setting  does move the bullets along with the content, but it also causes lines that wrap to start aligned with the bullet, instead of aligned with the line above. The problem is obviously caused by the bullet being rendered outside the box, the float pushing the contents of the box to the right (not the box itself). This is how IE and FF handle the situation, and as far as I know, not wrong according to the spec. The question is, how can I prevent it?

Traditionally, to call a JavaScript function once the page has loaded, you'd add an  attribute to the body containing a bit of JavaScript (usually only calling a function):  When the page has loaded, I want to run some JavaScript code to dynamically populate portions of the page with data from the server. I can't use the  attribute since I'm using JSP fragments, which have no  element I can add an attribute to. Is there any other way to call a JavaScript function on load? I'd rather not use jQuery as I'm not very familiar with it.

Unless I'm mistaken, creating a function in Python works like this:  However, you don't actually give the types of those parameters. Also, if I remember, Python is a strongly typed language, as such, it seems like Python shouldn't let you pass in a parameter of a different type than the function creator expected.  However, how does Python know that the user of the function is passing in the proper types? Will the program just die if it's the wrong type, assuming the function actually uses the parameter? Do you have to specify the type?

I'm having a lot of trouble finding specific information and examples on this.   I've got a number of jQuery UI dialogs in my application attached to divs that are loaded with .ajax() calls.  They all use the same setup call:  I just want to have the dialog resize to the width of the content that gets loaded.  Right now, the width just stays at 300px (the default) and I get a horizontal scrollbar. As far as I can tell, "autoResize" is no longer an option for dialogs, and nothing happens when I specify it. I'm trying to not write a separate function for each dialog, so  is not really an option, as each dialog is going to have a different width.   Specifying  for the dialog options just makes the dialogs take up 100% of the width of the browser window. What are my options?  I'm using jQuery 1.4.1 with jQuery UI 1.8rc1. It seems like this should be something that is really easy. EDIT: I've implemented a kludgy workaround for this, but I'm still looking for a better solution.
I'm planning to learn Perl 5 and as I have only used PHP until now, I wanted to know a bit about how the languages differ from each other.

Is it true that with Perl you have more options and ways to express something? Why is Perl not used for dynamic websites very often anymore? What made PHP gain more popularity?

I made a POST request to a HTTP (non-HTTPS) site, inspected the request in Chrome's Developer Tools, and found that it added its own header before sending it to the server:  After doing a search on , I can only find information about the server sending this header:  This seems related, but still very different since in my case, the CLIENT is sending the header in the Request, whereas all the information I've found is concerning the SERVER sending the related header in a Response.  So why is Chrome (44.0.2403.130 m) adding  to my request and what does it do?  Update 2016-08-24: This header has since been added as a W3C Candidate Recommendation and is now officially recognized. For those who just came across this question and are confused, the excellent answer by Simon East explains it well. The  header used to be  in the previous W3C Working Draft and was renamed quietly by Chrome before the change became officially accepted. (This question was asked during this transition when there were no official documentation on this header and Chrome was the only browser that sent this header.)

I have always used tabs for indentation when I do Python programming. But then I came across a question here on SO where someone pointed out that most Python programmers use spaces instead of tabs to minimize editor-to-editor mistakes. How does that make a difference? Are there other reasons why one would use spaces instead of tabs for Python? Or is it simply not true? Should I switch my editor to insert spaces instead of tabs right away or keep on going like I used to?

In C, the integer (for 32 bit machine) is 32 bits, and it ranges from -32,768 to +32,767. In Java, the integer is also 32 bits, but ranges from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. I do not understand how the range is different in Java, even though the number of bits is the same. Can someone explain this?

Recently I have experienced, that Xcode's simulator has become extremely slow. Also if I create a new app and run it i, the transition between the launch screen and the first view controller takes about 3 seconds. Luckily it is only the iOS 9 simulator and not iOS 8 or lower.    I have upgraded to Xcode 6.4 and I also have Xcode 7.0 beta 3 installed. Has anyone experienced the same? I have tried to uninstall both Xcode versions, but it didn't help.

I'm writing a program that parses 10 websites, locates data files, saves the files, and then parses them to make data that can be readily used in the NumPy library. There are tons of errors this file encounters through bad links, poorly formed XML, missing entries, and other things I've yet to categorize. I initially made this program to handle errors like this:  But now I want to log errors:  Note this is printing to a log file for later review. This usually prints very useless data. What I want is to print the exact same lines printed when the error triggers without the try-except intercepting the exception, but I don't want it to halt my program since it is nested in a series of for loops that I would like to see to completion.

Most of the examples quoted for usage of Dependency Injection, we can solve using the factory pattern as well. Looks like when it comes to usage/design the difference between dependency injection and factory is blurred or thin. Once someone told me that its how you use it that makes a difference!  I once used StructureMap a DI container to solve a problem, later on I redesigned it to work with a simple factory and removed references to StructureMap. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between them and where to use what, whats the best practice here?

According to the R language definition, the difference between  and  (correspondingly  and ) is that the former is vectorized while the later is not. According to the help text, I read the difference akin to the difference between an "And" and "AndAlso" (correspondingly "Or" and "OrElse")...meaning that not all evaluations if they don't have to be (i.e. A or B or C is always true if A is true, so stop evaluating if A is true) Could someone shed light here? Also, is there an AndAlso and OrElse in R?
How can a web application detect a paste event and retrieve the data to be pasted? I would like to remove HTML content before the text is pasted into a rich text editor. Cleaning the text after being pasted afterwards works, but the problem is that all previous formatting is lost. For example, I can write a sentence in the editor and make it bold, but when I paste new text, all formatting is lost. I want to clean just the text that is pasted, and leave any previous formatting untouched. Ideally, the solution should work across all modern browsers (e.g., MSIE, Gecko, Chrome, and Safari). Note that MSIE has , but I could not find similar functionality for other browsers.
Suppose we are given an array of n integers representing stock prices on a single day.  We want to find a pair (buyDay, sellDay), with buyDay ≤ sellDay, such that if we bought the stock on buyDay and sold it on sellDay, we would maximize our profit. Clearly there is an O(n2) solution to the algorithm by trying out all possible (buyDay, sellDay) pairs and taking the best out of all of them.  However, is there a better algorithm, perhaps one that runs in O(n) time?

Academia has it that table names should be the singular of the entity that they store attributes of.   I dislike any T-SQL that requires square brackets around names, but I have renamed a  table to the singular, forever sentencing those using the table to sometimes have to use brackets.   My gut feel is that it is more correct to stay with the singular, but my gut feel is also that brackets indicate undesirables like column names with spaces in them etc. Should I stay, or should I go?
I've been wondering whether there is a good "git export" solution that creates a copy of a tree without the  repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:   followed by removing the  repository directory.  alludes to this functionality but starts with "Just read the desired tree into the index..." which I'm not entirely sure how to do.  is a third party script that essentially does a  into a temporary location followed by  into the final destination.  None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to  might be option 1, because both those require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.
What is the difference between encrypting some data vs signing some data (using RSA)?   Does it simply reverse the role of the public-private keys?   For example, I want to use my private key to generate messages so only I can possibly be the sender.  I want my public key to be used to read the messages and I do not care who reads them.  I want to be able to encrypt certain information and use it as a product-key for my software.  I only care that I am the only one who can generate these.  I would like to include my public key in my software to decrypt/read the signature of the key.  I do not care who can read the data in the key, I only care that I am the only verifiable one who can generate them. Is signing useful in this scenario?
How to get the filename without the extension from a path in Python? I found out a method called  to get the filename with extension. But even when I import os, I am not able to call it . Is it possible to call it as directly as basename?
The 'id' field of my table auto increases when I insert a row. I want to insert a row and then get that ID. I would do it just as I said it, but is there a way I can do it without worrying about the time between inserting the row and getting the id? I know I can query the database for the row that matches the information that was entered, but there is a high change there will be duplicates, with the only difference being the id.
I have a Person object with a Nullable DateOfBirth property.  Is there a way to use LINQ to query a list of Person objects for the one with the earliest/smallest DateOfBirth value. Here's what I started with:  Null DateOfBirth values are set to DateTime.MaxValue in order to rule them out of the Min consideration (assuming at least one has a specified DOB). But all that does for me is to set firstBornDate to a DateTime value.  What I'd like to get is the Person object that matches that.  Do I need to write a second query like so:  Or is there a leaner way of doing it?
In the above code, is new int[100] generating the array on the heap? From what I've read on CLR via c#, the answer is yes. But what I can't understand, is what happens to the actual int's inside the array. As they are value types, I'd guess they'd have to be boxed, as I can, for example, pass myIntegers to other parts of the program and it'd clutter up the stack if they were left on it all the time. Or am I wrong? I'd guess they'd just be boxed and would live on the heap for as long the array existed.
I keep seeing "bootstrapping" mentioned in discussions of application development.  It seems both widespread and important, but I've yet to come across even a poor explanation of what bootstrapping actually is; rather, it seems as though everyone is just supposed to know what it means.  I don't, though.  Near as I can figure, it has something to do with initialization tasks required of an application upon launch, but I could be completely wrong about that.  Can anyone help me to understand this idea?

This is the  table, where the account number field needs to be updated:  And this is the  table, where I need to update from:  I tried the below, but no luck so far:  It updates the card numbers to account numbers, but the account numbers gets replaced by NULL

So about a year ago I started a project and like all new developers I didn't really focus to much on the structure, however now I am further along with Django it has started to appear that my project layout mainly my models are horrible in structure. I have models mainly held in a single app and really most of these models should be in their own individual apps, I did try and resolve this and move them with south however I found it tricky and really difficult due to foreign keys ect. However due to Django 1.7 and built in support for migrations is there a better way to do this now? Thank you in advance for any help.
I know this is a very popular question but I haven't been able to find a working solution for Laravel 5. I've been trying to migrate from Codeigniter for a long time, but this convoluted installation process keeps putting me off. I don't want to run a VM, this just seems awkward when switching between projects. I don't want to set my document root to the public folder, this is also awkward when switching between projects. I've tried the .htaccess mod_rewrite method  This just gives me a Laravel NotFoundHttpException in compiled.php line 7610. When I tried L4 a while ago, I used the method of moving the contents of the public folder into the root. The structure of L5 is quite different and following the same steps completely broke Laravel (the server would only return a blank page).

How to wait in a bash script for several subprocesses spawned from that script to finish and return exit code !=0 when any of the subprocesses ends with code !=0 ? Simple script:  The above script will wait for all 10 spawned subprocesses, but it will always give exit status 0 (see ). How can I modify this script so it will discover exit statuses of spawned subprocesses and return exit code 1 when any of subprocesses ends with code !=0? Is there any better solution for that than collecting PIDs of the subprocesses, wait for them in order and sum exit statuses?

I have searched high and low and get a lot of different solutions and varialbles containing info to get the absolute path. But they seem to work under some conditions and not under others. Is there one silver bullet way to get the absolute path to the current executing script in php? For me the script will be running from the command line but it should just as well function if run within apache etc. Clarification: The initial executed script, not the file we are currently in

Original Question: JSHint complains when my JavaScript calls a function that is defined further down the page than the call to it. However, my page is for a game, and no functions are called until the whole thing has downloaded. So why does the order functions appear in my code matter? EDIT: I think I may have found the answer. http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting I am groaning inside. Looks like I need to spend ANOTHER day re-ordering six thousand lines of code. The learning curve with javascript is not steep at all, but it is very loooooong.
Over the years I have slowly developed a regular expression that validates MOST email addresses correctly, assuming they don't use an IP address as the server part. I use it in several PHP programs, and it works most of the time.  However, from time to time I get contacted by someone that is having trouble with a site that uses it, and I end up having to make some adjustment (most recently I realized that I wasn't allowing 4-character TLDs). What is the best regular expression you have or have seen for validating emails? I've seen several solutions that use functions that use several shorter expressions, but I'd rather have one long complex expression in a simple function instead of several short expression in a more complex function.

The question is directed at people who have thought about code style in the context of the upcoming ECMAScript 6 (Harmony) and who have already worked with the language. With  and  we are getting two very similar ways to write functions in ES6. In other languages lambda functions often distinguish themselves by being anonymous, but in ECMAScript any function can be anonymous. Each of the two types have unique usage domains (namely when  needs to either be bound explicitly or explicitly not be bound). Between those domains there is a vast number of cases where either notation will do. Arrow functions in ES6 have at least two limitations:  Don't work with  Fixed  bound to scope at initialisation  These two limitations aside, arrow functions could theoretically replace regular functions almost anywhere. What is the right approach using them in practice? Should arrow functions be used e.g.:  "everywhere they work", i.e. everywhere a function does not have to be agnostic about the  variable and we are not creating an object. only "everywhere they are needed", i.e. event listeners, timeouts, that need to be bound to a certain scope with 'short' functions but not with 'long' functions only with functions that do not contain another arrow function  What I am looking for is a guideline to selecting the appropriate function notation in the future version of ECMAScript. The guideline will need to be clear, so that it can be taught to developers in a team, and to be consistent so that it does not require constant refactoring back and forth from one function notation to another.
It's possible to style a text input's placeholder with the following:  I am looking at a website online and I would like to use the same placeholder color as they do. Is it possible to figure out what color they used? I would like to include any alpha values, so I can't just sample the color with an image editor. When I inspect the element with Chrome Dev Tools, I see:  Dev tools does not provide information regarding the placeholder element when inspecting the input element. Is there another way?
Since this post has gotten a lot of attention over the years, I've listed the top solutions per platform at the bottom of this post.  Original post: I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I've googled this and came up with this tutorial, however it doesn't work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the  part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it's waiting for output/errors. I've also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well. So how can I leave it running when I shut down my local computer?  Top solutions:  Systemd (Linux) Launchd (Mac) node-windows (Windows) PM2 (Node.js)
I want to have a 2x2 grid with a buttons inside. This is only ICS so I am trying to use the new GridLayout given. Here's the XML of my layout:  The problem is that my views do not stretch evenly for each row. This causes a lot of extra space to the right of my GridLayout. I tried setting  but that only applies to the last view on the row. This means Cell 1 stretches all the way to give enough space for Cell 0. Thoughts on how to tackle this?

I have the branch  which tracks the remote branch . I want to rename them to  both locally and on the remote. Is that possible? For other users who tracked  (and who always updated their local  branch via ), what would happen after I renamed the remote branch?

Again, after I did this, what would happen now if the other users do ? I guess all this would result in a lot of trouble. Is there a clean way to get what I want? Or should I just leave  as it is and create a new branch  and just work there further on?

I have come across the awesome ctrlp.vim plugin. It is a good alternative to the Command-T plugin which I have used before. What I did not like about Command-T is that it would take about 20-30 seconds to rescan files when it is invoked for the first time after starting vim.  CtrlP works a lot faster but it does not seem to automatically rescan for newly created files. How should I trigger a rescan manually? Thanks!
Currently we are using the following commands in PHP to set the character set to UTF-8 in our application.  Since this is a bit of overhead, we'd like to set this as the default setting in MySQL.

At this point, I did the following to set the MySQL charset and collation variables to UTF-8:  Is that a correct way to handle this?

I've got some code that resizes an image so I can get a scaled chunk of the center of the image - I use this to take a  and return a small, square representation of an image, similar to what's seen in the album view of the Photos app. (I know I could use a  and adjust the crop mode to achieve the same results, but these images are sometimes displayed in ). I've started to notice some crashes in this code and I'm a bit stumped. I've got two different theories and I'm wondering if either is on-base. Theory 1) I achieve the cropping by drawing into an offscreen image context of my target size. Since I want the center portion of the image, I set the  argument passed to  to something that's larger than the bounds of my image context. I was hoping this was Kosher, but am I instead attempting to draw over other memory that I shouldn't be touching? Theory 2) I'm doing all of this in a background thread. I know there are portions of UIKit that are restricted to the main thread. I was assuming / hoping that drawing to an offscreen view wasn't one of these. Am I wrong? (Oh, how I miss  method.)

There are so many different ways to include JavaScript in a html page. I know about the following options:  inline code or loaded from external URI included in <head> or <body> tag [1,2] having none,  or  attribute (only external scripts) included in static source or added dynamically by other scripts (at different parse states, with different methods)  Not counting browserscripts from the harddisk, javascript:URIs and -attributes [3], there are already 16 alternatives to get JS executed and I'm sure I forgot something. I'm not so concerned with fast (parallel) loading, I'm more curious about the execution order (which may depend on loading order and document order). Is there a good (cross-browser) reference that covers really all cases? E.g. http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/defer/ only deals with 6 of them, and tests mostly old browsers. As I fear there's not, here is my specific question: I've got some (external) head scripts for initialisation and script loading. Then I've got two static, inline scripts in the end of the body. The first one lets the script loader dynamically append another script element (referencing external js) to the body. The second of the static, inline scripts wants to use js from the added, external script. Can it rely on the other having been executed (and why :-)?

I use IPython notebooks and would like to be able to select to create a 2.x or 3.x python notebook in IPython. I initially had Anaconda.  With Anaconda a global environment variable had to be changed to select what version of python you want and then IPython could be started.  This is not what I was looking for so I uninstalled Anaconda and now have set up my own installation using MacPorts and PiP.  It seems that I still have to use  to toggle between python 2.x and 3.x. which is no better than the anaconda solution. Is there a way to select what version of python you want to use after you start an IPython notebook, preferably with my current MacPorts build?

I've got this very simple thing that just outputs some stuff in CSV format, but it's got to be UTF-8. I open this file in TextEdit or TextMate or Dreamweaver and it displays UTF-8 characters properly, but if I open it in Excel it's doing this silly íÄ kind of thing instead. Here's what I've got at the head of my document:  This all seems to have the desired effect except Excel (Mac, 2008) doesn't want to import it properly. There's no options in Excel for me to "open as UTF-8" or anything, so … I'm getting a little annoyed. I can't seem to find any clear solutions to this anywhere, despite a lot of people having the same problem. The thing I see the most is to include the BOM, but I can't exactly figure out how to do that. As you can see above I'm just ing this data, I'm not writing any file. I can do that if I need to, I'm just not because there doesn't seem like a need for it at this point. Any help? Update: I tried echoing the BOM as  which I just pulled from a site that was trying to detect the BOM. But Excel just appends those three characters to the very first cell when it imports, and still messes up the special characters.

I was looking at the Java code for  and noticed that it made use of a static nested class, .  What is the reason for using a static nested class, rather than an normal inner class? The only reason I could think of, was that Entry doesn't have access to instance variables, so from an OOP point of view it has better encapsulation.  But I thought there might be other reasons, maybe performance. What might it be? Note. I hope I have got my terms correct, I would have called it a static inner class, but I think this is wrong: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html

I have a list of arbitrary length, and I need to split it up into equal size chunks and operate on it. There are some obvious ways to do this, like keeping a counter and two lists, and when the second list fills up, add it to the first list and empty the second list for the next round of data, but this is potentially extremely expensive. I was wondering if anyone had a good solution to this for lists of any length, e.g. using generators. I was looking for something useful in  but I couldn't find anything obviously useful. Might've missed it, though. Related question: What is the most “pythonic” way to iterate over a list in chunks?

I'm asking this question despite having read similar but not exactly what I want at C# naming convention for enum and matching property I found I have a tendency to name enums in plural and then 'use' them as singular, example:  Of course it works and this is my style, but can anyone find potential problem with such convention? I do have an "ugly" naming with the word "Status" though:  Additional Info: Maybe my question wasn't clear enough. I often have to think hard when naming the variables of the my defined enum types. I know the best practice, but it doesn't help to ease my job of naming those variables. I can't possibly expose all my enum properties (say "Status") as "MyStatus". My question: Can anyone find potential problem with my convention described above? It is NOT about best practice. Question rephrase: Well, I guess I should ask the question this way: Can someone come out a good generic way of naming the enum type such that when used, the naming of the enum 'instance' will be pretty straightforward?

How do I find which hamcrest.MatcherAssert it's using (ie which jar file it's using for hamcrest.MatcherAssert)?  AFAICT, the only hamcrest jars in my classpath is 1.3.RC2. Is IntelliJ IDEA using it's own copy of JUnit or Hamcrest? How do I output the runtime CLASSPATH that IntelliJ is using?

I set the page to scroll to top when a button is clicked.  But first I used an if statement to see if the top of the page was not set to 0.  Then if it's not 0 I animate the page to scroll to the top.  The tricky part now is animating something AFTER the page has scrolled to the top.  So my next thought is, find out what the page position is. So I used console log to find out.  This gave me a result of 365, I'm guessing that is the position number I was at just before scrolling to the top. My question is how do I set the position to be 0, so that I can add another animation that runs once the page is at 0? Thanks!
I am using the Bootstrap framework for my UI. I want to change the color of my glyphicons to blue, but not in all places. In some places it should use the default color.

Please note: I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2.
The  option in :  Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of revisions. A shallow repository has a number of limitations (you cannot clone or fetch from it, nor push from nor into it), but is adequate if you are only interested in the recent history of a large project with a long history, and would want to send in fixes as patches.   But I've successfully done a shallow clone, committed some changes and pushed those changes back to the (bare clone) origin. It makes sense to me - I mean why not? when the cloned HEAD is identifiable in the origin, and my commit comes on top of this, there seems no reason. But the manual says otherwise. I like the idea of shallow clone - e.g. of drupal core: there's no way I need to know what went on in drupal 4 when I've started from 7. - but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot. So is it safe to shallow clone, develop commits in it, pull again to keep up with updates from origin?

I've never seen  HTML tag  actually used anywhere before.  Are there pitfalls to its use that means I should avoid it? The fact that I have never noticed it in use on a modern production site (or any site) makes me leery of it, though it seems like it might have useful applications for simplifying links on my site.  Edit After using the base tag for a few weeks, I did end up finding some major gotchas with using the base tag that make it much less desirable than it first appeared.  Essentially, the changes to  and  under the base tag are very incompatible with their default behavior, and this change from the default behavior could easily make third party libraries outside of your control very unreliable  in unexpected ways, since they will logically depend on the default behavior.  Often the changes are subtle and lead to not-immediately-obvious problems when dealing with a large codebase.  I have since created an answer detailing the issues that I experienced below.  So test the link results for yourself before you commit to a widespread deployment of , is my new advice!

I'm converting an app to use fragments using the compatibility library. Now currently I have a number of activities (A B C D) which chain onto one another, D has a button 'OK' which when pressed calls finish which then bubbles up through onActivityResult to additionally destroy C and B. For my pre Honycomb fragment version each activity is effectively a wrapper on fragments Af Bf Cf Df. All activities are launched via startActivityForResult and onActivityResult within each of the fragments can happily call getActivity().finish The problem that I am having though is in my Honeycomb version I only have one activity, A, and fragments Bf, Cf, Df are loaded using the FragmentManager. What I don't understand is what to do in Df when 'OK' is pressed in order to remove fragments Df, Cf, and Bf?  I tried having the fragment popping itself off the stack but this resulted in an exception. onActivityResult is useless because I have not loaded up the fragment using startActivityForResult. Am I thinking about this completely the wrong way? Should I be implementing some sort of listener that communicates with either the parent fragment or activity in order to do the pop using the transaction manager?
Currently doing some exams and I'm struggling through some concepts. These have all been 'mentioned' in my notes really but I didn't really understand how they all linked together. As far as my understanding is: SOA - a solution to make service consumers/providers communicate. (as far as I understand this is the umbrella term for everything else) WSDL - A language that describes the provider service. SOAP - A XML protocol 'wrapper' used by the services to send messages. Works in conjunction with WSDL as to provide parameters? REST - A design pattern that is similar to SOAP in function but avoids the XML? (really not sure about this one) JSON - An alternative to XML that uses javascript? (not sure about this one either) Looking around in the internet there doesn't seem to be a clear definition of what all of these are and how they interlink.

I could simply hack the  file directly, but that seems nasty and, well, hacky. I tried doing  in the repo  directory, but that failed because I wasn't in a work tree. I tried  but that just updated refs/heads/master to be the same as refs/heads/otherbranch (okay, I did that one in a dummy repository, not my production one!) I tried  and that almost worked.  It updated the  file, but it set it to the SHA1 of the commit pointed to by . I'm testing with git version . I'm guessing there's no way to do this through , as allowing all and sundry to change your default branch seems a bit unsafe (!), but surely there's a better way to do it in the repo  directory than directly hacking the  file.

I decided to create simple isEven and isOdd function with a very simple algorithm:  That is OK if n is with certain parameters, but fails for many scenarios. So I set out to create robust functions that deliver correct results for as many scenarios as I could, so that only integers within the limits of javascript numbers are tested, everything else returns false (including + and - infinity). Note that zero is even.  Can anyone see any issues with the above? Is there a better (i.e. more accurate, faster or more concise without being obfuscated) version? There are various posts relating to other languages, but I can't seem to find a definitive version for ECMAScript. Edit A code review tag was added, but I'm not after a code review. I posted the code simply so others could see where I was up to, not as something to review. Answers posted so far seem to get that. Edit 2 A final function, based on Steve's answer:  Anything that is not a number returns undefined, numbers return either true or false. It could be one function with a strict flag, but I think the strict comparison is not really required.
With the iPhone SDK: I have a  with  that brings up a keyboard.

I've tried changing the class of my  to a  but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.   Do I need both a UIView and a ?  Does one go inside the other? [EDIT: I now know that you want a  inside of a , and the trick is to programatically set the content size of the  to the frame size of the .] Then what needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field? Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder.  I'd like to only write code for what needs it. Note: the  (or ) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (), which needs to function as normal.  Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.   I've got it working where I change the frame size of the  when the keyboard goes up and down.  I'm simply using:   However this doesn't automatically "move up" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.

I am developing an app and I use several third party APIs and SDKs such as Dropbox and Google Drive. These libraries requiers API keys. A private and a public one. Currently I have sth like this:  The App-Secret key should be kept private - but when releasing the app they can be reversed by some guys. I want to know what is the best thing to encrypt, obfuscate or whatever to make this secure. I thought about using ProGuard but setting up ProGuard for the whole project would take me some weeks. Thats why I wanted only to use ProGuard for these important classes storing private keys and other sensitible data. Is this ok or are there other ways? What do you think?
I looked at the default Zip library that comes with the JDK and the Apache compression libs and I am unhappy with them for 3 reasons:  They are bloated and have bad API design. I have to write 50 lines of boiler plate byte array output, zip input, file out streams and close relevant streams and catch exceptions and move byte buffers on my own? Why can't I have a simple API that looks like this  and  that just works? It seems zipping unzipping destroys file meta-data and password handling is broken. Also, all the libraries I tried were 2-3x slow compared to the command line zip tools I get with UNIX?  For me (2) and (3) are minor points but I really want a good tested library with a one-line interface.

This probably never happened in the real-world yet, and may never happen, but let's consider this: say you have a git repository, make a commit, and get very very unlucky: one of the blobs ends up having the same SHA-1 as another that is already in your repository. Question is, how would Git handle this? Simply fail? Find a way to link the two blobs and check which one is needed according to the context? More a brain-teaser than an actual problem, but I found the issue interesting.

In Apple's documentation about interacting with C APIs, they describe the way -marked C-style enumerations are imported as Swift enumerations. This makes sense, and since enumerations in Swift are readily provided as the  value type it's easy to see how to create our own. Further down, it says this about -marked C-style options:  Swift also imports options marked with the  macro. Whereas   options behave similarly to imported enumerations, options can also   support some bitwise operations, such as , , and . In Objective-C,   you represent an empty option set with the constant zero (). In   Swift, use  to represent the absence of any options.  Given that there isn't an  value type in Swift, how can we create a C-Style options variable to work with?
I have a  running under iOS 8 and I'm using automatic cell heights from constraints in a storyboard. One of my cells contains a single  and I need it to contract and expand based on user input - tap to shrink/expand the text. I'm doing this by adding a runtime constraint to the text view and changing the constant on the constraint in response to user events:  Whenver I do this, I wrap it in  updates and set the 's needs   When I do this, my cell does expand (and animates whilst doing it) but I get a constraints warning:  388 is my calculated height the other constraints on the  are mine from Xcode/IB. The final one is bothering me - I'm guessing that  is the calculated height of the cell when it is first rendered - (I set my  height to be >= 70.0) however it doesn't seem right that this derived constraint then overrules an updated user cnstraint. Worse, although the layout code says it's trying to break my height constraint, it doesn't - it goes on to recalculate the cell height and everything draws as I would like. So, what is   (I'm guessing it is the calculated height for automatic cell sizing) and how should I go about forcing it to recalculate cleanly?

I tried:  but it did not work.  I also tried using the IP instead (based on ifconfig) to access:  which did not work either.

Given a template where the HTML cannot be modified because of other requirements, how is it possible to display (rearrange) a  above another  when they are not in that order in the HTML? Both s contain data that varies in height and width.  Hopefully it is obvious that the desired result is:  When the dimensions are fixed it easy to position them where needed, but I need some ideas for when the content is variable. For the sake of this scenario, please just consider the width to be 100% on both. I am specifically looking for a CSS only solution (and it will probably have to be met with other solutions if that doesn't pan out).  There are other elements following this. A good suggestion was mentioned given the limited scenario I demonstrated -- given that it might be the best answer, but I am looking to also make sure elements following this aren't impacted.

I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible. For example, if I have a  class, I will write some unit tests for the  class.  Then, I begin writing my  class, and when it needs to interact with the  class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both  and ... at least in the places where they interact. Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes? In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature? Am I misunderstanding integration tests, or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests?  Edit Thanks for all the great responses everyone!  I think from the varied answers it's clear that the line between unit and integration tests is definitely a blurry line, and perhaps it's a bit pedantic to try and figure out which are which and the true focus should stay on the code (Thanks @Rob Cooper).  Also, sorry but I'm not going to accept any answer because too many are too good, and it really seems quite subjective.

I am getting an ORA-01000 SQL exception. So I have some queries related to it.  Are maximum open cursors exactly related to number of JDBC connections, or are they also related to the statement and resultset objects we have created for a single connection ? (We are using pool of connections) Is there a way to configure the number of statement/resultset objects in the database (like connections) ? Is it advisable to use instance variable statement/resultset object instead of method local statement/resultset object in a single threaded environment ? Does executing a prepared statement in a loop cause this issue ? (Of course, I could have used sqlBatch) Note: pStmt is closed once loop is over.  What will happen if conn.createStatement() and conn.prepareStatement(sql) are called multiple times on single connection object ?  Edit1:  6.

Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient. I was doing a naive search — picking one sock and "iterating" the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n2/8 socks on average. As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution. Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could). So, the question is basically: Given a pile of  pairs of socks, containing  elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.) I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:  A general theoretical solution for a huge number of socks. The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?) Is it equivalent to the element distinctness problem?

I am creating a small app to teach myself ASP.NET MVC and JQuery, and one of the pages is a list of items in which some can be selected. Then I would like to press a button and send a List (or something equivalent) to my controller containing the ids of the items that were selected, using JQuery's Post function. I managed to get an array with the ids of the elements that were selected, and now I want to post that. One way I could do this is to have a dummy form in my page, with a hidden value, and then set the hidden value with the selected items, and post that form; this looks crufty, though.  Is there a cleaner way to achieve this, by sending the array directly to the controller? I've tried a few different things but it looks like the controller can't map the data it's receiving. Here's the code so far:  And then my Controller looks like this  All I managed to get is a "null" in the controller parameter... Any tips?

Please ignore the red circles in Model #2: that is from another question I had which is now answered. Note:  I still need to put in an isDeleted check so I can soft delete it from DB1 if it has gone out of our client's inventory. All I want to do, with this particular code, is connect a company in DB1 with a client in DB2, get their product list from DB2 and INSERT it in DB1 if it is not already there.  First time through should be a full pull of inventory.  Each time it is run there after nothing should happen unless new inventory came in on the feed over night.  So the big question - how to I solve the transaction error I am getting?  Do I need to drop and recreate my context each time through the loops (does not make sense to me)?

I understand that the keystore would usually hold private/public keys and the trust store only public keys (and represents the list of trusted parties you intend to communicate with). Well, that's my first assumption, so if that's not correct, I probably haven't started very well... I was interested though in understanding how / when you distinguish the stores when using keytool. So, far I've created a keystore using  which creates my keystore.ks file. I answer  to the question do I trust bob but it is unclear to me if this has created a keystore file or a truststore file? I can set up my application to use the file as either.  and with  set, I can see the certificate under trusted certifications (but not under the keystore section). The particular certificate I'm importing has only a public key and I intend to use it to send stuff over an SSL connection to Bob (but perhaps that's best left for another question!). Any pointers or clarifications would be much appreciated. Is the output of keytool the same whatever you import and its just convention that says one is a keystore and the other a trust store? What's the relationship when using SSL etc?

This bug has been driving me nuts since I started using Xcode (4.6.3). Whenever I try to link a Storyboard item to my code, I get the error "Could not find any information for class named ViewController." This happens with custom classes as well.

(See below solution I created using the answer I accepted) I'm trying to improve the maintainability of some code involving reflection. The app has a .NET Remoting interface exposing (among other things) a method called Execute for accessing parts of the app not included in its published remote interface.  Here is how the app designates properties (a static one in this example) which are meant to be accessible via Execute:  So a remote user could call:   and the app would use reflection to find SomeClass.SomeProperty and return its value as a string. Unfortunately, if someone renames SomeProperty and forgets to change the 3rd parm of ExposeProperty(), it breaks this mechanism. I need to the equivalent of:   to use as the 3rd parm in ExposeProperty so refactoring tools would take care of renames. Is there a way to do this? Thanks in advance. Okay, here's what I ended up creating (based upon the answer I selected and the question he referenced):  Usage:  Now with this cool capability, it's time to simplify the ExposeProperty method. Polishing doorknobs is dangerous work... Thanks everyone.

When is it right for a constructor to throw an exception? (Or in the case of Objective C: when is it right for an init'er to return nil?) It seems to me that a constructor should fail -- and thus refuse to create an object -- if the object isn't complete. I.e., the constructor should have a contract with its caller to provide a functional and working object on which methods can be called meaningfully? Is that reasonable?

So, for example:  I don't begin to understand this, but I guess these are indices into the levels of the factors of the columns (of the court of king caractacus) of ? Not what I need. Strangely I can go through the columns of  by hand, and do  which works fine. And, after some typing, I can get a data.frame whose columns are characters rather than factors. So my question is: how can I do this automatically? How do I convert a data.frame with factor columns into a data.frame with character columns without having to manually go through each column?  Bonus question: why does the manual approach work?
I'm writing my first Android application and trying to get my head around communication between services and activities. I have a Service that will run in the background and do some gps and time based logging. I will have an Activity that will be used to start and stop the Service.  So first, I need to be able to figure out if the Service is running when the Activity is started. There are some other questions here about that, so I think I can figure that out (but feel free to offer advice). My real problem: if the Activity is running and the Service is started, I need a way for the Service to send messages to the Activity. Simple Strings and integers at this point - status messages mostly. The messages will not happen regularly, so I don't think polling the service is a good way to go if there is another way. I only want this communication when the Activity has been started by the user - I don't want to start the Activity from the Service. In other words, if you start the Activity and the Service is running, you will see some status messages in the Activity UI when something interesting happens. If you don't start the Activity, you will not see these messages (they're not that interesting). It seems like I should be able to determine if the Service is running, and if so, add the Activity as a listener. Then remove the Activity as a listener when the Activity pauses or stops. Is that actually possible? The only way I can figure out to do it is to have the Activity implement Parcelable and build an AIDL file so I can pass it through the Service's remote interface. That seems like overkill though, and I have no idea how the Activity should implement writeToParcel() / readFromParcel(). Is there an easier or better way? Thanks for any help. EDIT:  For anyone who's interested in this later on, there is sample code from Google for handling this via AIDL in the samples directory: /apis/app/RemoteService.java

Since this post has gotten a lot of attention over the years, I've listed the top solutions per platform at the bottom of this post.  Original post: I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I've googled this and came up with this tutorial, however it doesn't work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the  part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it's waiting for output/errors. I've also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well. So how can I leave it running when I shut down my local computer?  Top solutions:  Systemd (Linux) Launchd (Mac) node-windows (Windows) PM2 (Node.js)

C# desktop application on express edition. Worked then didn't work 5 seconds later. I tried the following.  Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug info are set on all assemblies. Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLLs related to the project from my entire machine. Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch. Reboot.  I have two WinForms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug info, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug info on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?  I want to add in here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.
If I have the following:  I can use the following selector to find the first two DIVs:  However, if I have this:  It will only find the second DIV, since the first div's class is returned as a string (I think) and doesn't actually start with 'apple-' but rather 'some-' One way around that is to not use starts with, but instead contains:  The problem with that is it will also select the 3rd DIV in my example. Question: Via jQuery, what is the proper way to use predicate selectors on individual class names, rather than the entire class attribute as a string?

With the NoSQL movement growing based on document-based databases, I've looked at MongoDB lately.  I have noticed a striking similarity with how to treat items as "Documents", just like Lucene does (and users of Solr). So, the question: Why would you want to use NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, etc) over Lucene (or Solr) as your "database"? What I am (and I am sure others are) looking for in an answer is some deep-dive comparisons of them.  Let's skip over relational database discussions all together, as they serve a different purpose.  Lucene gives some serious advantages, such as powerful searching and weight systems.  Not to mention facets in Solr (which Solr is being integrated into Lucene soon, yay!).  You can use Lucene documents to store IDs, and access the documents as such just like MongoDB.  Mix it with Solr, and you now get a WebService-based, load balanced solution. You can even throw in a comparison of out-of-proc cache providers such as Velocity or MemCached when talking about similar data storing and scalability of MongoDB. The restrictions around MongoDB reminds me of using MemCached, but I can use Microsoft's Velocity and have more grouping and list collection power over MongoDB (I think).  Can't get any faster or scalable than caching data in memory.  Even Lucene has a memory provider. MongoDB (and others) do have some advantages, such as the ease of use of their API.  New up a document, create an id, and store it.  Done.  Nice and easy.
I've been fiddling with WebGL lately, and have gotten a Collada reader working. Problem is it's pretty slow (Collada is a very verbose format), so I'm going to start converting files to a easier to use format (probably JSON). Thing is, I already have the code to parse the file in Javascript, so I may as well use it as my exporter too! The problem is saving. Now, I know that I can parse the file, send the result to the server, and have the browser request the file back from the server as a download. But in reality the server has nothing to do with this particular process, so why get it involved? I already have the contents of the desired file in memory. Is there any way that I could present the user with a download using pure javascript? (I doubt it, but might as well ask...) And to be clear: I am not trying to access the filesystem without the users knowledge! The user will provide a file (probably via drag and drop), the script will transform the file in memory, and the user will be prompted to download the result. All of which should be "safe" activities as far as the browser is concerned. [EDIT]: I didn't mention it upfront, so the posters who answered "Flash" are valid enough, but part of what I'm doing is an attempt to highlight what can be done with pure HTML5... so Flash is right out in my case. (Though it's a perfectly valid answer for anyone doing a "real" web app.) That being the case it looks like I'm out of luck unless I want to involve the server. Thanks anyway!

How do you test an element for existence without the use of the  method? I have setup a live demo for reference. I will also print the code on here as well:  Basically what the above code demonstrates is an element being stored into a variable and then removed from dom. Even though the element has been removed from the dom, the variable retains the element as it was when first declared. In other words, it is not a live reference to the element itself, but rather a replica. As a result, checking the variable's value (the element) for existence will provide an unexpected result. The  function is my attempt to check for an elements existence from a variable, and it works, but I would like to know if there is an easier way to accomplish the same result. PS: I'm also interested in why JavaScript variables behave like this if anyone knows of some good articles related to the subject.

I was having a discussion with a teammate about locking in .NET.  He's a really bright guy with an extensive background in both lower-level and higher-level programming, but his experience with lower level programming far exceeds mine.  Anyway, He argued that .NET locking should be avoided on critical systems expected to be under heavy-load if at all possible in order to avoid the admittedly small possibility of a "zombie thread" crashing a system.  I routinely use locking and I didn't know what a "zombie thread" was, so I asked.  The impression I got from his explanation is that a zombie thread is a thread that has terminated but somehow still holds onto some resources.  An example he gave of how a zombie thread could break a system was a thread begins some procedure after locking on some object, and then is at some point terminated before the lock can be released.  This situation has the potential to crash the system, because eventually, attempts to execute that method will result in the threads all waiting for access to an object that will never be returned, because the thread that is using the locked object is dead.   I think I got the gist of this, but if I'm off base, please let me know.  The concept made sense to me.  I wasn't completely convinced that this was a real scenario that could happen in .NET.  I've never previously heard of "zombies", but I do recognize that programmers who have worked in depth at lower levels tend to have a deeper understanding of computing fundamentals (like threading).  I definitely do see the value in locking, however, and I have seen many world class programmers leverage locking.  I also have limited ability to evaluate this for myself because I know that the  statement is really just syntactic sugar for:   and because  and  are marked .  It seems conceivable that .NET does some kind of processing that protects threads from exposure to system components that could have this kind of impact, but that is purely speculative and probably just based on the fact that I've never heard of "zombie threads" before.  So, I'm hoping I can get some feedback on this here:  Is there a clearer definition of a "zombie thread" than what I've explained here? Can zombie threads occur on .NET?  (Why/Why not?)   If applicable, How could I force the creation of a zombie thread in .NET? If applicable, How can I leverage locking without risking a zombie thread scenario in .NET?  Update I asked this question a little over two years ago.  Today this happened:

NOTE: There are many different answers here, and most have been valid at one time or another. The fact is that what works has changed a number of times as the Angular team has changed its Router.

As of RC.3, the preferred solution is to use  as shown in this answer. In an Angular application (current in the 2.0.0-beta.0 release as I write this), how do you determine what the currently active route is?

Any suggestions or links would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Tim Pope argues for a particular git commit message style in his blog post: http://www.tpope.net/node/106 Here is a quick summary of what he recommends:  First line is 50 characters or less Then a blank line Remaining text should be wrapped at 72 characters  His blog post gives the rationale for these recommendations (which I will call "50/72 formatting" for brevity):  In practice, some tools treat the first line as a subject line and the second paragraph as a body (similar to email)  does not handle wrapping, so it is hard to read if lines are too long.  converts commits to email -- so to play nice it helps if your commits are already wrapped nicely. a point I would like to add that I think Tim would agree with: the act of summarizing your commit is a good practice inherently in any version control system. It helps others (or a later you) find relevant commits more quickly.  So, I have a couple of parts to my question:  What chunk (roughly) of the 'thought leaders' or 'experienced users' of git embrace the 50/72 formatting style? I ask this because sometime newer users don't know or don't care about community practices. For those that don't use this formatting, is there a principled reason for using a different formatting style? (Please note that I'm looking for an argument on the merits, not "I've never heard of it" or "I don't care.") Empirically speaking, what percentage of git repositories embrace this style? (In case someone wants to do an analysis on GitHub repositories... hint, hint.)  My point here is not to recommend the 50/72 style or shoot down other styles. (To be open about it, I do prefer it, but I am open to other ideas.) I just want to get the rationale for why people like or oppose various git commit message styles. (Feel free to bring up points that haven't been mentioned, too.)

How do I force an overwrite of local files on a ? The scenario is following:  A team member is modifying the templates for a website we are working on They are adding some images to the images directory (but forgets to add them under source control) They are sending the images by mail, later, to me I'm adding the images under the source control and pushing them to GitHub together with other changes They cannot pull updates from GitHub because Git doesn't want to overwrite their files.  The errors I'm getting are:  error: Untracked working tree file 'public/images/icon.gif' would be overwritten by merge.  How do I force Git to overwrite them? The person is a designer - usually I resolve all the conflicts by hand, so the server has the most recent version that they just needs to update on their computer.

While using IntelliJ 13 ultimate edition for a week, it just seems really slow. First of all, the whole IDE stops for a second or so every once in a while. The Java editor's auto complete is really slow compared to 12 version. I have not changed anything from the default settings other than using a Dracula theme. It seems that this is not a problem of my own. Many people suggested setting the heap size higher than default, or clearing the cache, but I have not checked or tested on these suggestion. Do I need to change some setting to improve the new version's performance?
I installed Visual Studio 2012 and DevExpress 13.1. As Visual studio started, it generated an error shown by this attached image,  The 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Editor.Implementation.EditorPackage' package did not load correctly.

I am working on an application and one design approach involves extremely heavy use of the  operator. While I know that OO design generally tries to avoid using , that is a different story and this question is purely related to performance. I was wondering if there is any performance impact? Is is just as fast as ? For example, I have a base class with 10 subclasses. In a single function that takes the base class, I do checks for if the class is an instance of the subclass and carry out some routine.  One of the other ways I thought of solving it was to use a "type id" integer primitive instead, and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses, and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses "type id" to a constant mask representing the category. Is  somehow optimized by the JVM to be faster than that? I want to stick to Java but the performance of the app is critical. It would be cool if someone that has been down this road before could offer some advice. Am I nitpicking too much or focusing on the wrong thing to optimize?
I'm a web-game developer and I got a problem with random numbers. Let's say that a player has 20% chance to get a critical hit with his sword. That means, 1 out of 5 hits should be critical. The problem is I got very bad real life results — sometimes players get 3 crits in 5 hits, sometimes none in 15 hits. Battles are rather short (3-10 hits) so it's important to get good random distribution. Currently I use PHP , but we are just moving our code to C++, so I want to solve this problem in our game's new engine. I don't know if the solution is some uniform random generator, or maybe to remember previous random states to force proper distribution.

We all know that in order to invoke , this call must be placed in synchronized block, otherwise an  is thrown. But what's the reason for making this restriction? I know that  releases the monitor, but why do we need to explicitly acquire the monitor by making particular block synchronized and then release the monitor by calling ? What is the potential damage if it was possible to invoke  outside a synchronized block, retaining it's semantics - suspending the caller thread?

I have some code that makes a call to a third party web service that is secured using X.509 certification. If I call the code directly (using a unit test) it works without any problems. When deployed, this code will be called via a WCF Service. I have added a second unit test that calls the WCF Service, however this fails with a , message  when I call a method on the third party web service. I presume that this is because my WCF Service will be attempting to call the third party web service using a different user to myself. Can anyone shed any additional light on this issue?
Any pointers on how to solve efficiently the following function in Haskell, for large numbers   I've seen examples of memoization in Haskell to solve fibonacci numbers, which involved computing (lazily) all the fibonacci numbers up to the required n.

First of all: yes, I read all the other threads on this topic. And not only those from this site... (you see, I'm a little frustrated) Most of them come with the advice to use  instead of just  in the XML file. I did. From others, I learned, that  works different than . I handled that, too. In my , I use:  In my Activity I do:  and in my custom view class:  which returns . Doing this, my Activity works fine. So maybe it's because of the  and  differences. So I stored the context passed to the customs view constructor locally and tried:  which also returned . Then, I changed my custom view to extend  instead  and changed the  to let the  be a direct child of my custom view, so that the  should work as supposed. Suprise: it didn't solve anything. So what the heck am I doing wrong?  I'll appreciate any comments.

I'm new to git and would appreciate help with adding submodules. I've received two projects sharing some common code. The shared code was just copied into the two projects. I created a separate git repo for the common code and removed it from the projects with the plan to add it as a git submodule.  I used the path option of git submodule add to specify the folder:  but then got the error:  This is the desired structure of my repository:  It is possible to add the git submodule directly in the repo or into a new folder there, but not in the projectfolder.

I downloaded the full ISO for Visual Studio Ultimate CTP 6.  The installation program got to about the 90% mark, gauging by the progress bar, and just stuck there.  There was frequent activity from Superfetch, Anti-malware protection, and other background processes, but the progress bar was dead still.  Eventually the background task activity subsided after 20 minutes, but the progress bar still wouldn't budge. CHEAP TRICK: Open a notepad window and position the left edge of it so it perfectly marks the current position of the progress bar.  If it the progress bar doesn't move past the left edge of the notepad window in about an hour, it's probably stuck.

I have a lot of changes in a working folder, and something screwed up trying to do an update. Now when I issue an 'svn cleanup' I get:  MemPoolTests.cpp is a new file another developer added and was brought down in the update. It did not exist in my working folder before. Is there anything I can do to try and move forward without having to checkout a fresh copy of the repository? Clarification: Thanks for the suggestions about moving the directory out of the way and bringing down a new copy. I know that is an option, but it is one I'd like to avoid since there are many changes nested several directories deep (this should have been a branch...) I'm hoping for a more aggressive way of doing the cleanup, maybe someway of forcing the file SVN is having trouble with back into a known state (and I tried deleting the working copy of it ... that didn't help).

One of the stated reasons for knowing assembler is that, on occasion, it can be employed to write code that will be more performant than writing that code in a higher-level language, C in particular.  However, I've also heard it stated many times that although that's not entirely false, the cases where assembler can actually be used to generate more performant code are both extremely rare and require expert knowledge of and experience with assembly.   This question doesn't even get into the fact that assembler instructions will be machine-specific and non-portable, or any of the other aspects of assembler.  There are plenty of good reasons for knowing assembly besides this one, of course, but this is meant to be a specific question soliciting examples and data, not an extended discourse on assembler versus higher-level languages. Can anyone provide some specific examples of cases where assembly will be faster than well-written C code using a modern compiler, and can you support that claim with profiling evidence?  I am pretty confident these cases exist, but I really want to know exactly how esoteric these cases are, since it seems to be a point of some contention.

It's widely mentioned that Redis is "Blazing Fast" and mongoDB is fast too. But, I'm having trouble finding actual numbers comparing the results of the two. Given similar configurations, features and operations (and maybe showing how the factor changes with different configurations and operations), etc, is Redis 10x faster?, 2x faster?, 5x faster? I'm ONLY speaking of performance. I understand that mongoDB is a different tool and has a richer feature set.  This is not the "Is mongoDB better than Redis" debate. I'm asking, by what margin does Redis outperform mongoDB? At this point, even cheap benchmarks are better than no benchmarks.
I am a Java programmer who is new to the corporate world. Recently I've developed an application using Groovy and Java. All through the code I wrote used quite a good number of statics. I was asked by the senior technical lot to cut down on the number of statics used. I've googled about the same, and I find that many programmers are fairly against using static variables. I find static variables more convenient to use. And I presume that they are efficient too (please correct me if I am wrong), because if I had to make 10,000 calls to a function within a class, I would be glad to make the method static and use a straightforward  on it instead of cluttering the memory with 10,000 instances of the class, right? Moreover statics reduce the inter-dependencies on the other parts of the code. They can act as perfect state holders. Adding to this I find that statics are widely implemented in some languages like Smalltalk and Scala. So why is this oppression for statics prevalent among programmers (especially in the world of Java)? PS: please do correct me if my assumptions about statics are wrong.
I'm looking for a quick way to type and Enter or Return key in Selenium. Unfortunately the form I'm trying to test (not my own code so I can't modify) doesn't have a Submit button. When working with it manually, I just type ENTER or RETURN. I need to know how to do that with the Selenium  command as there is no button to click.

I like how Java has a Map where you can define the types of each entry in the map, for example .  What I'm looking for is a type of collection where each element in the collection is a pair of values.  Each value in the pair can have its own type (like the String and Integer example above), which is defined at declaration time.   The collection will maintain its given order and will not treat one of the values as a unique key (as in a map).   Essentially I want to be able to define an ARRAY of type  or any other 2 types.   I realize that I can make a class with nothing but the 2 variables in it, but that seems overly verbose.   I also realize that I could use a 2D array, but because of the different types I need to use, I'd have to make them arrays of OBJECT, and then I'd have to cast all the time.   I only need to store pairs in the collection, so I only need two values per entry.  Does something like this exist without going the class route?  Thanks!

I'm encountering the exact issue as described here (read section "Cannot Attach to Deleted MDF File"), but the solution to the problem is not told there...

I'm having a hard time getting my head around font scaling. I currently have this site with a body  of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16px.  I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16px whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full blown widescreen desktop. How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using  but this doesn't scale either. My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px  of  among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (E.g in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.) I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as WELL as having extra breakpoints, otherwise I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100px decrease in width to control the text.
What are the values in JavaScript that are 'falsey', meaning that they evaluate as false in expressions like ,  and ?  There are some discussions of the purpose of falsey values on Stack Overflow already, but no exhaustive complete answer listing what all the falsey values are. I couldn't find any complete list on MDN JavaScript Reference, and I was surprised to find that the top results when looking for a complete, authoritative list of falsey values in JavaScript were blog articles, some of which had obvious omissions (for example, ), and none of which had a format like Stack Overflow's where comments or alternative answers could be added to point out quirks, surprises, omissions, mistakes or caveats. So, it seemed to make sense to make one.

I am using Eclipse 3.3 ("Europa"). Periodically, Eclipse takes an inordinately long time (perhaps forever) to start up. The only thing I can see in the Eclipse log is:      !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.resources 2 10035 2008-10-16 09:47:34.801     !MESSAGE The workspace exited with unsaved changes in the previous session; refreshing workspace to recover changes.  Googling reveals someone's suggestion that I remove the folder:  This does not appear to have helped. Short of starting with a new workspace (something which I am not keen to do, as it takes me hours to set up all my projects again properly), is there a way to make Eclipse start up properly?
In Java, static final variables are constants and the convention is that they should be in upper-case.

Should we be using LOGGER instead?

I have a very similar problem as described here. I also upgraded a mixed solution of C++/CLI and C# projects from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010. And now in Visual Studio 2010 one C++/CLI project always runs out of date. Even if it has been compiled and linked just before and F5 is hit, the messagebox "The project is out of date. Would you like to build it?" appears. This is very annoying because the DLL file is very low-tiered and forces almost all projects of the solution to rebuild. My pdb settings are set to the default value (suggested solution of this problem). Is it possible the get the reason why Visual Studio 2010 forces a rebuild or thinks a project is up to date? Any other ideas why Visual Studio 2010 behaves like that?

Try:  If it works for you ignore the rest of this post. Intro I started setting up my Ubuntu 12.10 on April 2013 and the normal   was not working for maven 3 back then.  The manual installation in this post is useful if you like to dig in deeper to your ubuntu kernel in regards with apt-get and where it finds the list of applications that are available for installation on Ubuntu . It can also be potentially useful for more recent releases of Ubuntu like Ubuntu 15.04, etc. if you face the same problem as I did back then with Ubuntu 12.10.  Automatic Installation via apt-get: Checkout the manual installation if your current ubuntu can not install maven via common 'apt-get install maven'.  Make sure to remove maven 2 if your ubuntu is not fresh or if you were using maven 2 before:  Manual Installation via apt-get by adding maven 3 repository (Ubuntu 14.04 check out update 1): This can be useful if your ubuntu apt-get repositories list is not up to date. Maven 3 was required to set up the system and as it turns out most of the documents out there are referring to how to install Maven to Ubuntu version 12.04 or before. Best document I found was: killertilapia's blog The whole process I came up with is as follows:   Add the following line the  file:  deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/natecarlson/maven3/ubuntu precise main  deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/natecarlson/maven3/ubuntu precise main      Caution 1: command "sudo apt-add-repository ppa:natecarlson/maven3" did not work on my  Ubuntu and had to run  to get my apt-get to work again. Caution 2: thanks to David, you need to remove your existing symbolic link to previous versions of maven before running step 4.  OS X Installation I decided to add OS X installation in case you use multiple environments for your dev: See the source stackoverflow thread for more details. Install Homebrew that is the equavalent of , then install Maven using:  Update 1: Installation for Ubunutu 14.04 Haven't tried this myself but I am confident this should work without security warnings:  Note: source here, many thanks and +1s to @rendybjunior, @Dominic_Bartl, and @FunThomas424242

Is there a way to tell IntelliJ never to use wildcard imports? Under 'Settings > Code Style > Imports', I can see that you can specify the 'class count' prior to IntelliJ using wildcard imports.  However, if I never want to use wildcard imports can I turn this functionality off?   I have tried putting -1 or leaving the field blank but that just tells IntelliJ to always use wildcard imports.  Obviously a not-so-nice solution would be to put a ridiculously high number so that you never encounter wildcard imports but I was hoping there was a nicer way to just turn it off.
I am trying to get my first taste of Android development using Eclipse. I ran into this problem when trying to run Eclipse, having installed version 4.2 only minutes ago.

I've got an image library on Amazon S3. For each image, I md5 the source URL on my server plus a timestamp to get a unique filename. Since S3 can't have subdirectories, I need to store all of these images in a single flat folder. Do I need to worry about collisions in the MD5 hash value that gets produced? Bonus: How many files could I have before I'd start seeing collisions in the hash value that MD5 produces?
It looks like the lists returned by  and  methods of a dictionary are always a 1-to-1 mapping (assuming the dictionary is not altered between calling the 2 methods). For example:  If you do not alter the dictionary between calling  and calling , is it wrong to assume the above for-loop will always print True?  I could not find any documentation confirming this.

I am learning Python and creating a database connection. While trying to add to the DB, I am thinking of creating tuples out of information and then add them to the DB.  What I am Doing: I am taking information from the user and store it in variables.  Can I add these variables into a tuple?  Can you please help me with the syntax? Also if there is an efficient way of doing this, please share... EDIT Let me edit this question a bit...I only need the tuple to enter info into the DB.  Once the information is added to the DB, should I delete the tuple?  I mean I don't need the tuple anymore.
I have a bunch of unannotated tags in the repository and I want to work out which commit they point to. Is there a command that that will just list the tags and their commit SHAs? Checking out the tag and looking at the HEAD seems a bit too labourious to me. Update I realised after I went through the responses that what I actually wanted was to simply look at the history leading up to the tag, for which  is sufficient.  The answer that is marked as answer is useful for getting a list of tags and their commits, which is what I asked. With a bit of shell hackery i'm sure it's possible to transform those into SHA+Commit message.

Recently, Facebook released SDK 4 with new and cool updates. I tried to switch into SDK4 to use new features, however, I am struggling with the Login feature of Facebook.  So far, to log out Facebook programmatically, I used :   But SDK4 seems not to support Session anymore, and in official docs, they mention:   There are two ways to implement Facebook login on Android: LoginButton class - Which provides a button you can add to your UI. It follows the current access token and can log people in and out.  Well, seems there's no way to log out Facebook programmatically except using LoginButton. Anyone have any idea, please share it here.

When embedding JavaScript in an HTML document, where is the proper place to put the  tags and included JavaScript? I seem to recall that you are not supposed to place these in the  section, but placing at the beginning of the  section is bad, too, since the JavaScript will have to be parsed before the page is rendered completely (or something like that). This seems to leave the end of the  section as a logical place for  tags. So, where is the right place to put the  tags? (This question references this question, in which it was suggested that JavaScript function calls should be moved from  tags to  tags. I'm specifically using jQuery, but more general answers are also appropriate.)

How do I remove an element from an array when I know the elements name? for example: I have an array:  the user enters   is removed. To fully explain: I have a database that stores a list of items separated by a comma. The code pulls in the list based on a user choice where that choice is located. So, if they choose strawberry they code pulls in every entry were strawberry is located then converts that to an array using split(). I want to them remove the user chosen items, for this example strawberry, from the array.
I have a Unicode string in Python, and I would like to remove all the accents (diacritics). I found on the Web an elegant way to do this in Java:  convert the Unicode string to its long normalized form (with a separate character for letters and diacritics) remove all the characters whose Unicode type is "diacritic".  Do I need to install a library such as pyICU or is this possible with just the python standard library?  And what about python 3? Important note: I would like to avoid code with an explicit mapping from accented characters to their non-accented counterpart.
I have a shell script with this code:  But the conditional code always executes, because  always prints at least one newline character.

I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:  Q1: We have a bag containing numbers , , , …, . Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.  I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:  A1: Well, the sum of the numbers  is  (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For , the sum is . Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly . Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in  time and  space.  At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:  Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?  I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution. The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: "useful") programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer. The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.  Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?  This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a  time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the  time input scan) is defined in k not N. So the question here is simple:  How would you solve Q2? How would you solve Q3? How would you solve Qk?   Clarifications  Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100. I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using  bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N. I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).  So again, of course you must scan the input in , but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

In Java we see lots of places where the  keyword can be used but its use is uncommon.  For example:  In the above case,  can be  but this is commonly left off.  When a method is never going to be overridden we can use final keyword. Similarly in case of a class which is not going to be inherited. Does the use of final keyword in any or all of these cases really improve performance? If so, then how? Please explain. If the proper use of  really matters for performance, what habits should a Java programmer develop to make best use of the keyword?

We need to display a tick symbol (✓ or ✔) within an internal web app and would ideally like to avoid using an image.

The following displays boxes although sets browser encoding to UTF-8 (META works nicely and not the issue).

The following works under IE 6.0 and IE 7:  I would appreciate if someone could check under FF on Windows. I am pretty sure it won't work on a non Windows box.
I'm creating custom elements in my app and want to match the look and feel of the new iOS. iOS 7 introduced to us a very common lighter blue color, the default color or tint for several elements, including the system button, segmented control, etc. They've made it easy to select the color using IB, as seen here:  However, I haven't found how to easily access the color programmatically. I checked out the UIColor documentation, and there doesn't seem to be any accessor for the blue system color in the class itself. Here's my question: does a simple accessor exist for this color?  or something like it? If not, does someone know the exact RGB values for that color?

This crash has been a blocking issue, basically I used following steps to reproduce the issue:  Create a Cocoa Touch Framework project Add a swift file and a class Dog Build framework for device Create a Single View application in Swift Import framework into app project Instantiate swift class from the framework in ViewController Build and run app on device  The app immediate crashed upon launching, here is console log:  I have tried to build on iOS 7.1 and 8.0 devices, they both have the same crash. However I can build app and run on simulator fine. Also I am aware that I can change the framework to from Required to Optional in Link Binary With Libraries, but it did not completely resolve the problem, the app crashed when I create an instance of Dog. The behavior is different on device and simulator, I suspect that we can't distribute framework for device using beta version of Xcode. Can anyone shed light on this?

I frequently use  and  to save and restore changes in my working tree. Yesterday I had some changes in my working tree that I had stashed and popped, and then I made more changes to my working tree. I'd like to go back and review yesterday's stashed changes, but  appears to remove all references to the associated commit. I know that if I use  then .git/refs/stash contains the reference of the commit used to create the stash. And .git/logs/refs/stash contains the whole stash. But those references are gone after . I know that the commit is still in my repository somewhere, but I don't know what it was. Is there an easy way to recover yesterday's stash commit reference? Note that this isn't critical for me today because I have daily backups and can go back to yesterday's working tree to get my changes. I'm asking because there must be an easier way!

I'm using JavaScript with the jQuery library to manipulate image thumbnails contained in a unordered list. When the image is loaded it does one thing, when an error occurs it does something else. I'm using jQuery load() and error() methods as events. After these events I check the image DOM element for the .complete to make sure the image wasn't already loaded before jQuery could register the events. It works correctly except when an error occurs before jQuery can register the events. The only solution I can think of is to use the img onerror attribute to store a "flag" somewhere globally (or on the node it's self) that says it failed so jQuery can check that "store/node" when checking .complete. Anyone have a better solution? Edit: Bolded main points and added extra detail below: I'm checking if an image is complete (aka loaded) AFTER I add a load and error event on the image. That way, if the image was loaded before the events were registered, I will still know. If the image isn't loaded after the events then the events will take care of it when it does. The problem with this is, I can easily check if an image is loaded already, but I can't tell if an error occurred instead.

How can I empty (clear) the logcat buffer in Android? I use adb logcat from command line and pipe the output to a file, since the DDMS has a very limited buffer.

The only way I've found so far to clear the buffer, is reboot. This is effective, but would like to know if there's an easier way.

C# desktop application on express edition. Worked then didn't work 5 seconds later. I tried the following.  Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug info are set on all assemblies. Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLLs related to the project from my entire machine. Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch. Reboot.  I have two WinForms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug info, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug info on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?  I want to add in here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.
After installing Visual Studio 2012 and opening my solution I get a series of errors in this form:  The Web Application Project Foo is configured to use IIS.   Unable to access the IIS metabase.

I am very new to Sublime Text and I am sure this is a naive question. Watching the Multiple line selection at http://www.sublimetext.com/ (2/6 slide).  Absolutely love it.   I understand that Ctrl (Cmd)+Shift+L "multiple-selects" so that we could do the edit simultaneously.  However, in the demo, they also merge all the lines into 1 single line. What is the shortcut for that? I used Ctrl+J but it just deletes once and not all the occurrences of new line. I use TextPad and use Find/Replace  with an empty space. But it seems that the person giving the demo uses some kind of shortcut.

Is there a default/official/recommended way to parse CSV files in C#? I don't want to roll my own parser. Also, I've seen instances of people using ODBC/OLE DB to read CSV via the Text driver, and a lot of people discourage this due to its "drawbacks." What are these drawbacks? Ideally, I'm looking for a way through which I can read the CSV by column name, using the first record as the header / field names. Some of the answers given are correct but work to basically deserialize the file into classes.

I have read articles about the differences between SOAP and REST as a web service communication protocol, but I think that the biggest advantages for REST over SOAP are:   REST is more dynamic, no need for creating and updating UDDI. REST is not restricted to XML format. REST web services can send plain text, JSON, and also XML.  But SOAP is more standardized (Ex; security). So, am I correct in these points?

I seem to have a problem with performance of "sbt test" after upgrading to macOS Sierra. On a previous version of OS X it took about 40-50 seconds to finish. macOS Sierra times are much higher than that. Last run I did was around 15 minutes. Compile times are about the same as on 'El Capitan'. I'm the only one from my team to try this new macOS so I can't tell if it's only happening on my mac or is it a universal issue. My colleague had a similar issue on Ubuntu and it was related with random number generation slowing down the tests - Slow service response Times : Java SecureRandom & /dev/random Unfortunately, that didn't work for me. Originally I tried that on JDK 8u54 and then tried updating to JDK 8u102 and that didn't help as well. P.S. I'm running Macbook Pro Mid-2015 2.8GHz i7, 16GB ram, 1TB SSD.
I've had a bug in our software that occurs when I receive a connection timeout. These errors are very rare (usually when my connection gets dropped by our internal network). How can I generate this kind of effect artificially so I can test our software?  If it matters the app is written in C++/MFC using CAsyncSocket classes. Edit: I've tried using a non-existent host, and I get the socket error:  WSAEINVAL (10022) Invalid argument  My next attempt was to use Alexander's suggestion of connecting to a different port, e.g. 81 (on my own server though). That worked great. Exactly the same as a dropped connection (60 second wait, then error). Thank you!

I have a multi-step registration process, backed by a single object in domain layer, which have validation rules defined on properties. How Should I validate the domain object when the domain is split across many views, and I have to save the object partially in the first view when posted? I thought about using Sessions but That's not possible cause the process is lengthy and amount of data is high, So I don't want to use session. I thought about saving all the data in an relational in-memory db (with the same schema as main db)and then flushing that data to main db but issues arisen cause I should route between services (requested in the views) who work with the main db and in-memory db. I 'm looking for an elegant and clean solution (more precisely a best practice). UPDATE AND Clarification: @Darin Thank you for your thoughtful reply,  That was exactly what I've done till now.

I've recently started learning ExtJS, and have trouble understanding how to handle Events. I have no experience of any previous versions of ExtJS.  From reading various manuals, guides and documentation pages, I've figured out how to use it, but I'm not clear on how it works. I've found several tutorials for older versions of ExtJS, but I'm not sure how applicable they are in ExtJS 4. I'm specifically looking on the "final word" on things like  what arguments does an event handling function get passed? Is there a standard set of args that always get passed? how to define custom events for custom components we write? how can we fire these custom event? does the return value (true/false) affect how the event bubbles? If not, how can we control event bubbling from within, or outside of the event handler? is there a standard way to register event listeners? (I've come across two different ways til now, and I'm not sure why each method was used).  For example, this question leads me to believe that an event handler can receive quite a few arguments. I've seen other tutorials where there are just two arguments to the handler. What changes?
I'm using git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:  : import of existing codebase plus a few mods that I'm generally sure of  : experimental branch #1 : experimental branch #2   and  represent two very different architectural approaches.  Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work.  As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those. What is the best way to merge selective files from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else? Approaches I've considered:   followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches. Manual copying of common files into a temp directory followed by  to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temp directory into the working tree. A variation on the above.  Abandon the  branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.  All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make  more selective.
I have written my own function to scroll text fields up when the keyboard shows up. In order to dismiss the keyboard by tapping away from the text field, I've created a  that takes care of resigning first responder on the text field when tapping away. Now I've also created an autocomplete for the textfield that creates a  just below the text field and populates it with items as the user enters text. However, when selecting one of the entries in the auto completed table,  does not get called. Instead, it seems that the tap gesture recognizer is getting called and just resigns first responder. I'm guessing there's some way to tell the tap gesture recognizer to keep passing the tap message on down to the , but I can't figure out what it is. Any help would be very appreciated.
I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the  activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.  The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and . This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the  for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bit wise)?   This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with touch screen because of focus issue. (I can use roller ball.)  I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.  As soon as I disabled the image on the list view it worked fine again. FYI: This is how I was doing it:  Where  is a . Here is my LogCat:  I also have a new error when displaying an image:

Is there a function built into Java that capitalizes the first character of each word in a String, and does not affect the others? Examples:   ->   ->  (B remains capital, this rules out Title Case)  -> *  *( would be find too, but I don't expect it to be THAT smart.) A quick look at the Java String Documentation reveals only  and , which of course do not provide the desired behavior. Naturally, Google results are dominated by those two functions. It seems like a wheel that must have been invented already, so it couldn't hurt to ask so I can use it in the future.

Recently I have come across this problem which I am unable to understand by myself. What do these three Expressions REALLY mean?  I have tried Ritchie. But unfortunately was unable to follow what he told about these 3 operations. I know they are all performed to increment the pointer/the value pointed to. I can also guess there may be a lot of things about precedence and order of evaluation. Like one increments the pointer first then fetches the content of that pointer, one simply fetches the content and then increments the pointer etc etc. As you can see, I don't have a clear understanding about their actual operations, which i would like to clear as soon as possible. But I am truly lost when I get a chance to apply them in programs. For example:  gives me this output:  But my expectation was that it would print  . One final request -- Please give me examples for how each expression works in a given code snippet. As most of the time only a mere paragraph of theory gets flown over my head.

I was wondering how to unit test abstract classes, and classes that extend abstract classes. Should I test the abstract class by extending it, stubbing out the abstract methods, and then test all the concrete methods? Then only test the methods I override, and test the abstract methods in the unit tests for objects that extend my abstract class? Should I have an abstract test case that can be used to test the methods of the abstract class, and extend this class in my test case for objects that extend the abstract class? Note that my abstract class has some concrete methods.

Edit: It appears that setting  to a value greater than the theoretical amount of columns you may have will work, but it will not work if you have table-layout set to fixed. Are there any disadvantages to using an automatic layout with a large number for ? Is there a more correct way of doing this?
The idiom I use the most when programming in Java is to test if  before I use it. This is to avoid a NullPointerException. I find the code very ugly, and it becomes unreadable.

I have a Unicode string in Python, and I would like to remove all the accents (diacritics). I found on the Web an elegant way to do this in Java:  convert the Unicode string to its long normalized form (with a separate character for letters and diacritics) remove all the characters whose Unicode type is "diacritic".  Do I need to install a library such as pyICU or is this possible with just the python standard library?  And what about python 3? Important note: I would like to avoid code with an explicit mapping from accented characters to their non-accented counterpart.
I often find myself writing if / elif / else constructs in python, and I want to include options which can occur, but for which the corresponding action is to do nothing.

I'm curious what exactly decorators are in AngularJS. There isn't much information online for decorators save for a blurb in the AngularJS documentation and a brief (albeit interesting) mention in a youtube video. As the Angular guys put it a decorator is:  Decoration of service, allows the decorator to intercept the service   instance creation. The returned instance may be the original instance,   or a new instance which delegates to the original instance.  I don't really know what that means, and I'm not sure why you would separate this logic from the service itself. For example if I wanted to return something different under different conditions I would just pass different arguments to the relevant functions or use another function sharing that private state. I'm still kind of an AngularJS noob so I'm sure it's just ignorance and/or bad habits I've picked up.
Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows a web page to make XMLHttpRequests to another domain (from wikipedia), and it's pretty important (from me :). I've been fiddling with CORS for the last couple of days and I think I have a pretty good understanding of how everything works.  So my question is not about how CORS / preflight work, it's about the reason behind coming up with preflights as a new request type. I fail to see any reason why server A needs to send a preflight (PR) to server B just to find out if the real request (RR) will be accepted or not - it would certainly be possible for B to accept/reject RR without any prior PR.  After searching quite a bit I found this piece of information at www.w3.org (7.1.5):  To protect resources against cross-origin requests that could not originate from certain user agents before this specification existed a   preflight request is made to ensure that the resource is aware of this   specification.  I find this is the hardest to understand sentence ever. My interpretation (should better call it 'best guess') is that it's about protecting server B against requests from server C that is not aware of the spec.  Can someone please explain a scenario / show a problem that PR + RR solves better than RR alone?

I am pretty sure that there is an easier solution, but I seem unable to find it! Edit: Now I have   However, I do get the following exception at the "fromJson" line:  I do catch JsonParseExceptions and "result" is not null. I checked listType with the debugger and got the following:  list Type    args = ListOfTypes   list = null resolvedTypes = Type[ 1 ]  loader = PathClassLoader ownerType0 = null ownerTypeRes = null rawType = Class (java.util.ArrayList) rawTypeName = "java.util.ArrayList"   so it seems the "getClass" invocation didn't work properly. Any suggestions...? Edit2: I'v checked on the Gson User Guide. It mentions a Runtime Exception that should happen during parsing a generic type to Json. I did it "wrong" (not shown above), just as in the example, but didn't get that exception at all. So I changed the serialization as in the user guide suggested. Didn't help, though. Edit3:  Solved, see my answer below.
I've been fiddling with WebGL lately, and have gotten a Collada reader working. Problem is it's pretty slow (Collada is a very verbose format), so I'm going to start converting files to a easier to use format (probably JSON). Thing is, I already have the code to parse the file in Javascript, so I may as well use it as my exporter too! The problem is saving. Now, I know that I can parse the file, send the result to the server, and have the browser request the file back from the server as a download. But in reality the server has nothing to do with this particular process, so why get it involved? I already have the contents of the desired file in memory. Is there any way that I could present the user with a download using pure javascript? (I doubt it, but might as well ask...) And to be clear: I am not trying to access the filesystem without the users knowledge! The user will provide a file (probably via drag and drop), the script will transform the file in memory, and the user will be prompted to download the result. All of which should be "safe" activities as far as the browser is concerned. [EDIT]: I didn't mention it upfront, so the posters who answered "Flash" are valid enough, but part of what I'm doing is an attempt to highlight what can be done with pure HTML5... so Flash is right out in my case. (Though it's a perfectly valid answer for anyone doing a "real" web app.) That being the case it looks like I'm out of luck unless I want to involve the server. Thanks anyway!

I am new to linux system programming and I came across API and ABI while reading Linux System Programming. Definition of API :  An API defines the interfaces by which   one piece of software communicates   with another at the source level.  Definition of ABI :  Whereas an API defines a source   interface, an ABI defines the   low-level binary interface between two   or more pieces of software on a   particular architecture. It defines   how an application interacts with   itself, how an application interacts   with the kernel, and how an   application interacts with libraries.  How can a program communicate at a source level ? What is a source level ? Is it related to source code in anyway? Or the source of the library gets included in the main program ? The only difference I know is API is mostly used by programmers and ABI is mostly used by compiler.
I know that Esc + . gives you the last argument of the last command. But I'm interested in first argument of the last command. Is there a key binding to do so? On the same lines, is there a generic way of getting the nth argument from the last command? I know that in a bash script, you can use ,  etc., but these don't work on the commandline. Also, what about iterating through the 0th argument of previous commands, like we can do with the last argument by continuously pressing Esc + .?
See below the solid line for my original question. I have a folder in my local directory that is untracked. When I run , I get:  When I type  then try  again, it still says untracked.

I'm developing an ASP MVC web project. Now I have a requirement which forces me to deploy to an IIS7 inmiddle of development (to check some features). I'm getting the above mentioned error message whenever I try to type the URL of the web site. (Note: development machine: Vista Home Premium, IIS7) What I have done until now: Edited the HOSTS file (C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts). Put two domains in it (127.0.0.1  domain1.com   &   127.0.0.1  domain2.com). Created a folder c:\websites\dirOfApplication and deployed from within Visual Studio 8 to this folder. In IIS7 created a new site with host name domain1.com and application folder the above. Typing the address domain1.com in Web browser results in the above error (HTTP Error 403.14 - Forbidden - The Web server is configured to not list the contents of this directory.) I think I'm missing something but don't know what! Tryed to deploy the files  System.Web.Mvc, System.Web.Abstraction & System.Web.Routing wit the same outcome. Whenever I try to hit F5 and run the application, it works fine!

When the div is hovered over, a CSS transition effect moves the div. The problem, as you can see in the example, is that the 'translate' transition has the horrible side effect of making the image in the div move by 1px down/right (and possibly resize ever so slightly?) so that it appears out of place and out of focus... The glitch seems to apply the whole time the hover effect is applied, and from a process of trial and error I can safely say only seems to occur when the translate transition moves the div (box shadow and opacity are also applied but make no difference to the error when removed). 2nd EDIT: Actually, problem NOT solved! In creating a JSFiddle to illustrate the problem I stumbled across an interesting observation. The problem only happens when the page has scrollbars. So the example with just one instance of the div is fine, but once more identical divs are added and the page therefore requires a scrollbar the problem strikes again... Any ideas?!

I am using OS X 10.9.1 (Mavericks). What are the systematic steps to install to Gvim or MacVim in Mac OS? If you write the steps using 1, 2, 3, ..., it would be easy to follow.

So I am looking at a heap with jmap on a remote box and I want to force garbage collection on it. How do you do this without popping into jvisualvm or jconsole and friends? I know you shouldn't be in the practice of forcing garbage collection -- you should just figure out why the heap is big/growing. I also realize the System.GC() doesn't actually force garbage collection -- it just tells the GC that you'd like it to occur. Having said that is there a way to do this easily? Some command line app I'm missing?

I'm looking for a small function that allows me to remove the extension from a filename. I've found many examples by googling, but they are bad, because they just remove part of the string with "." . They use dot for limiter and just cut string. Look at these scripts,  or  When we add the string like this:  This.is example of somestring  It will return only "This"...

The following code works in Google Chrome beta as well as IE 7. However, Firefox seems to have a problem with this. I'm suspecting it to be a problem of how my CSS files are included, cause I know Firefox is not too friendly about cross-domain imports. But this is all just static HTML and there's no question of cross-domain. On my landing-page.html I do a CSS import like so:  Within the main.css I have another imports like so:  and within the type.css I have the following declarations:  I have a directory called "font" in the same location as type.css. This font directory contains all the woff/ttf/svg files etc. I'm stumped on this one. It works in Chrome and IE but not on Firefox. How is this possible? What am I missing?
As the GPU driver vendors don't usually bother to implement  in GLSL, I'm looking for a "graphics randomization swiss army knife" utility function set, preferably optimised to use within GPU shaders. I prefer GLSL, but code any language will do for me, I'm ok with translating it on my own to GLSL. Specifically, I'd expect: a) Pseudo-random functions - N-dimensional, uniform distribution over [-1,1] or over [0,1], calculated from M-dimensional seed (ideally being any value, but I'm OK with having the seed restrained to, say, 0..1 for uniform result distribution). Something like:  b) Continous noise like Perlin Noise - again, N-dimensional, +- uniform distribution, with constrained set of values and, well, looking good (some options to configure the appearance like Perlin levels could be useful too). I'd expect signatures like:  I'm not very much into random number generation theory, so I'd most eagerly go for a pre-made solution, but I'd also appreciate answers like "here's a very good, efficient 1D rand(), and let me explain you how to make a good N-dimensional rand() on top of it..." .
I know there are a few posts about Newtonsoft so hopefully this isn't exactly a repeat...I'm trying to convert JSON data returned by Kazaa's API into a nice object of some kind  That JsonConvert line is just the most recent one I was trying...I'm not quite getting it and was hoping to eliminate some footwork by asking you guys. I was originally trying to convert it into a Dictionary or something...and actually, I just need to snag a couple of values in there so judging by the documentation, maybe Newtonsoft's LINQ to JSON might be a better choice? Thoughts/Links? Here is an example of the JSON return data:   I did some more reading and found Newtonsoft's LINQ to JSON is exactly what I wanted...using WebClient, Stream, StreamReader, and Newtonsoft...I can hit Kazaa for JSON data, extract a URL, download the file, and do it all in like seven lines of code! I love it.   This post gets so many hits I thought it might be helpful to include the "using" bits that are discussed in the comments.
How can I specify a  tag should span all columns (when the exact amount of columns in the table will be variable/difficult to determine when the HTML is being rendered)? w3schools mentions you can use , but it doesn't say exactly what browsers support that value (IE 6 is in our list to support).  Edit: It appears that setting  to a value greater than the theoretical amount of columns you may have will work, but it will not work if you have table-layout set to fixed. Are there any disadvantages to using an automatic layout with a large number for ? Is there a more correct way of doing this?
First of all, I'm assuming this is too complex for CSS3, but if there's a solution in there somewhere, I'd love to go with that instead. The HTML is pretty straightforward.  The child div is set to display:none; by default, but then changes to display:block; when the mouse is hovered over the parent div. The problem is that this markup appears in several places on my site, and I only want the child to be displayed if the mouse is over it's parent, and not if the mouse is over any of the other parents (they all have the same class name and no IDs). I've tried using  and  to no avail.

What is the best way to represent and solve a maze given an image?  Given an JPEG image (as seen above), what's the best way to read it in, parse it into some data structure and solve the maze? My first instinct is to read the image in pixel by pixel and store it in a list (array) of boolean values:  for a white pixel, and  for a non-white pixel (the colours can be discarded). The issue with this method, is that the image may not be "pixel perfect". By that I simply mean that if there is a white pixel somewhere on a wall it may create an unintended path. Another method (which came to me after a bit of thought) is to convert the image to an SVG file - which is a list of paths drawn on a canvas. This way, the paths could be read into the same sort of list (boolean values) where  indicates a path or wall,  indicating a travel-able space. An issue with this method arises if the conversion is not 100% accurate, and does not fully connect all of the walls, creating gaps. Also an issue with converting to SVG is that the lines are not "perfectly" straight. This results in the paths being cubic bezier curves. With a list (array) of boolean values indexed by integers, the curves would not transfer easily, and all the points that line on the curve would have to be calculated, but won't exactly match to list indices. I assume that while one of these methods may work (though probably not) that they are woefully inefficient given such a large image, and that there exists a better way. How is this best (most efficiently and/or with the least complexity) done? Is there even a best way? Then comes the solving of the maze. If I use either of the first two methods, I will essentially end up with a matrix. According to this answer, a good way to represent a maze is using a tree, and a good way to solve it is using the A* algorithm. How would one create a tree from the image? Any ideas? TL;DR Best way to parse? Into what data structure? How would said structure help/hinder solving? UPDATE I've tried my hand at implementing what @Mikhail has written in Python, using , as @Thomas recommended. I feel that the algorithm is correct, but it's not working as hoped. (Code below.) The PNG library is PyPNG.

I've spent a few months trying to grasp the concepts behind WCF and recently I've developed my first WCF service application. I've struggled quite a bit to understand all the settings in the config file. I am not convinced about the environment but it seems that you can do amazing stuff with it. The other day I've found out that Microsoft has come out with a new thing called ASP.NET Web API. For what I can read it's a RESTful framework, very easy to use and implement. Now, I am trying to figure out what are the main differences between the 2 frameworks and if I should try and convert my old WCF service application with the new API. Could someone, please, help me to understand the differences and usage of each?

What is the difference between  and ? About  Google's guide says:  This version of the pager is best for use when there are a handful of   typically more static fragments to be paged through, such as a set of   tabs. The fragment of each page the user visits will be kept in   memory, though its view hierarchy may be destroyed when not visible.   This can result in using a significant amount of memory since fragment   instances can hold on to an arbitrary amount of state. For larger sets   of pages, consider FragmentStatePagerAdapter.  And about :  This version of the pager is more useful when there are a large number   of pages, working more like a list view. When pages are not visible to   the user, their entire fragment may be destroyed, only keeping the   saved state of that fragment. This allows the pager to hold on to much   less memory associated with each visited page as compared to   FragmentPagerAdapter at the cost of potentially more overhead when   switching between pages.  So I have just 3 fragments. But all of them is a separate module with large amount of data.   handle some data (which user enter) and via activity pass it into , which is just simple .  is also . So my questions are: Which adapter should I use?  or ? I would greatly appreciate for your help. Alex. P.S. Sorry for my English:)

How do I center a div of one column size within the container (12 columns) in Twitter Bootstrap 3. Please see the starter fiddle.   So, I want a , with a class  to be centered within the container. I may use a row if there are multiple divs, but for now I just want a div with size of one column centered within the container (12 columns). I am also not sure the above approach is good enough as the intention is not to offset the  by half. I do not need free spaces outside the  and the contents of the  shrink in proportion. I want to empty space outside the div to be evenly distributed (shrink till the container width == one column).
When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.  But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a  representing the name of the team, etc.. So then I think:  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a ) and a running total of scores (an ). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is , so I will inherit from it:   But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from . I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects. Why not? Apparently  is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend ? What exactly will break? Another reason I've seen is that  is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a "public API". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from  and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have? Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change? And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from , why didn't they make the class ? What else am I supposed to use? Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a  class which should be extended instead of . But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as , for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow  not better than no ? Inheriting from  is way more work than inheriting from , and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting  is actually not the right solution for my problem. I've seen suggestions such as implementing . Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing. Lastly, some suggest wrapping the  in something:   There are two problems with this:  It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call  instead of just . Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal ... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work? It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't "have" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say "John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players". You say "John has joined SomeTeam". You don't add a letter to "a string's characters", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.  I realize that what happens "under the hood" can be said to be "adding X to Y's internal list", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world. My question (summarized) What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, "logically" (that is to say, "to the human mind") is just a  of  with a few bells and whistles?

How to generate a date time stamp, using the format standards for ISO 8601 and RFC 3339? The goal is a string that looks like this:  Format:  year, month, day, as "XXXX-XX-XX" the letter "T" as a separator hour, minute, seconds, milliseconds, as "XX:XX:XX.XXX". the letter "Z" as a zone designator for zero offset, a.k.a. UTC, GMT, Zulu time.  Best case:  Swift source code that is simple, short, and straightforward. No need to use any additional framework, subproject, cocoapod, C code, etc.  I've searched StackOverflow, Google, Apple, etc. and haven't found a Swift answer to this.  The classes that seem most promising are , , . Related Q&A: How do I get ISO 8601 date in iOS? Here's the best I've come up with so far:
Hi guys I'm creating a HTTP request on Angular, but I do not know how to add url arguments (query string) to it.  Now my StaticSettings.BASE_URL is something like a url with no query string like: http://atsomeplace.com/ but I want it to be http://atsomeplace.com/?var1=val1&var2=val2 Where var1, and var2 fit on my Http request object? I want to add them like an object.  and then just the Http module do the job to parse it into URL query string.

How do I easily copy the GNU screen scrollback buffer to a file? IE, a  more powerful version of the 'hardcopy' command?  In GNU screen, I can use "ctrl-a ESC" to enter the scrollback  buffer. I could then mark the entire buffer and use "ctrl-a ctrl-]" to  paste it into an emacs buffer, thus saving it to a file.  However, this is tedious. Is there a screen command that'll simply  copy the scrollback buffer to a file, like 'hardcopy' does for the  visible portion of the screen?

I can find a way to send parameters to my activity from my notification. I have a service that creates a notification. When the user clicks on the notification I want to open my main activity with some special parameters. E.g an item id, so my activity can load and present a special item detail view. More specific, I'm downloading a file, and when the file is downloaded I want the notification to have an intent that when clicked it opens my activity in a special mode. I have tried to use  on my intent, but cant seem to extract it, so I think I'm doing it wrong. Code from my service that creates the Notification:  Code from my Activity that tries to fetch the extra parameter from the notification:  The extras is always null and I never gets anything into my log. Btw... the  is only run when my activity starts, if my activity is already started I  also want to collect the extras and present my activity according to the item_id I receive. Any ideas?

I know there are a plethora of $_SERVER variables headers available for IP address retrieval. I was wondering if there is a general consensus as to how to most accurately retrieve a user's real IP address (well knowing no method is perfect) using said variables? I spent some time trying to find an in depth solution and came up with the following code based on a number of sources. I would love it if somebody could please poke holes in the answer or shed some light on something perhaps more accurate. edit includes optimizations from @Alix  Words of Warning (update)  still represents the most reliable source of an IP address. The other  variables mentioned here can be spoofed by a remote client very easily. The purpose of this solution is to attempt to determine the IP address of a client sitting behind a proxy. For your general purposes, you might consider using this in combination with the IP address returned directly from  and storing both. For 99.9% of users this solution will suit your needs perfectly. It will not protect you from the 0.1% of malicious users looking to abuse your system by injecting their own request headers. If relying on IP addresses for something mission critical, resort to  and don't bother catering to those behind a proxy.

I'm running some administrative queries and compiling results from  in SQL Server 2008 to look at data/index space ratios of some tables in my database.  Of course I am getting all sorts of large numbers in the results and my eyes are starting to gloss over.  It would be really convenient if I could format all those numbers with commas (987654321 becomes 987,654,321).  Funny that in all the many years I've used SQL Server, this issue has never come up since most of the time I would be doing formatting at the presentation layer, but in this case the T-SQL result in SSMS is the presentation. I've considered just creating a simple CLR UDF to solve this, but it seems like this should be do-able in just plain old T-SQL.  So, I'll pose the question here - how do you do numeric formatting in vanilla T-SQL?
I know that setting  on an element is used to centre it (left-right).

The package I happen to be interested in is http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.Async, but I would like to know how to do this generally. In the world of Ruby this would be easy - every package page on the RubyGems website has a download link to a .gem file, e.g.: https://rubygems.org/gems/pony   The argument over NuGet's manifest destiny belongs elsewhere. It doesn't matter to this question why I eschew it. I'm not the only one though.

I'm really having a difficult time grasping the concept of Django's content types. It feels very hackish and, ultimately, against how Python tends to do things.  That being said, if I'm going to use Django then I have to work within the confines of the framework. So I'm coming here wondering if anyone can give a practical real world example of how a content type works and how you would implement it. Almost all the tutorials (mostly on blogs) I have reviewed don't do a great job really covering the concept. They seem to pick up where the Django documentation left off (what seems like nowhere).

I am using a Universal Storyboard in Xcode 6, targeting iOS 7 and above. I've implemented a  which is now natively supported on iPhone running iOS 8, and Xcode will automatically backport it for iOS 7. It's working really well, except when you launch the app on iPhone in portrait running iOS 8, the split view's detail view controller is displayed when I expected to first see the master view controller. I believed this was a bug with iOS 8 because when you run the app on iOS 7, it correctly shows the master view controller. But iOS 8 is now GM and this is still occurring. How can I set it up so that when the split view controller is going to be collapsed (only one view controller displayed on screen), when the split view controller is displayed it shows the master view controller not the detail? I've created this split view controller in Interface Builder. The split view controller is the first view controller within a tab bar controller. Both the master and the detail VCs are navigation controllers with table view controllers embedded inside.

Obviously the beta for Angular2 is newer than new, so there's not much information out there, but I am trying to do what I think is some fairly basic routing.  Hacking about with the quick-start code and other snippets from the https://angular.io website has resulted in the following file structure:  With the files being populated as follows: index.html  boot.ts  app.component.ts  routing-test.component.ts  Attempting to run this code produces the error:  I found a vaguely related issue here; router-link directives broken after upgrading to angular2.0.0-beta.0. However, the "working example" in one of the answers is based on pre-beta code - which may well still work, but I would like to know why the code I have created is not working. Any pointers would be gratefully received!

What is the best way to generate an MD5 (or any other hash) of a multi-dimensional array?  I could easily write a loop which would traverse through each level of the array, concatenating each value into a string, and simply performing the MD5 on the string.  However, this seems cumbersome at best and I wondered if there was a funky function which would take a multi-dimensional array, and hash it.

How can I pull objects from the container that are transient in nature? Do I have to register them with the container and inject in the constructor of the needing class? Injecting everything into the constructor doesn't feel good. Also just for one class I don't want to create a  and inject the factory  into the needing class. Another thought that came to me was "new" them up on need basis. But I am also injecting a  component (through property) into all my classes. So if I new them up, I will have to manually instantiate the  in those classes. How can I continue to use the container for ALL of my classes? Logger injection: Most of my classes have the  property defined, except where there is inheritance chain (in that case only the base class has this property, and all the deriving classes use that). When these are instantiated through Windsor container, they would get my implementation of  injected into them.  Questions:  How do I create new  object without using "new"?  is , whereas  is "Scoped". How can I inject  into  method?
I've seen a fair share of ungainly XML->JSON code on the web, and having interacted with Stack's users for a bit, I'm convinced that this crowd can help more than the first few pages of Google results can. So, we're parsing a weather feed, and we need to populate weather widgets on a multitude of web sites.  We're looking now into Python-based solutions. This public weather.com RSS feed is a good example of what we'd be parsing (our actual weather.com feed contains additional information because of a partnership w/them). In a nutshell, how should we convert XML to JSON using Python?

What is this? This is a number of answers about warnings, errors and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in adding to and maintaining this list.  Why is this? Questions like "Headers already sent" or "Calling a member of a non-object" pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in his/her particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error can not easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad, because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply. What should I do here? If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone. If you want to contribute, please add your "favorite" error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&A that are of value.

An interviewer asked me: What is  and  and when should we use them?

I've got an  with an , and i want to calculate its content size (for return in  needed for adjusting its height via AutoLayout).  The problems is: Even if I have a fixed and equal height for all cells, I don't know how many "rows"/lines I have in the . I also can't determine that count by the number of items in my data source, since the cells representing the data items vary in width, so does consequently the number of items I have in one line of the . Since I couldn't find any hints on this topic in the official documentation and googling didn't bring me any further, any help and ideas would be appreciated very much.
Ok, so we know that setting padding to an object causes its width to change even if it is set explicitly. While one can argue the logic behind this, it causes some problems with some elements. For most cases, you just add a child element and add padding to that one instead of the one set to 100%, but for form inputs, that's not a possible step. Take a look at this: http://sandman.net/test/formcss.html The second input has its padding set to 5px which I very much prefer to the default setting. But unfortunately that makes the input grow 10px in all directions, including adding 10px to the 100% width. Problem here is that I can't add a child element inside the input so I can't fix it. So the question is: Is there any way to add padding inside the input while still keeping the width 100%? It need to be 100% since the forms will render in different width parents so I don't know beforehand the width of the parent.

I have a text input. When the input receives focus I want to select the text inside of the input. With jQuery I'd do it this way:   I've searched around to try and find the Angular way but most examples I'm finding are dealing with a directive that is watching a modal property for a change. I'm assuming I need a directive that is watching for an input that receives focus. How would I do that?

I am currently working with materialize CSS and it seems I've gotten snagged with the select fields. I'm using the example provided from their site but unfortunately it it's rendering in the view whatsoever.  I was wondering if someone else might be able to help.

I'm following this tutorial from angular.io As they said, I've created hero.spec.ts file to create unit tests:  Unit Tests work like a charm. The problem is: I see some errors, which are mentioned in tutorial:  Our editor and the compiler may complain that they don’t know what    and  are because they lack the typing files that describe   Jasmine. We can ignore those annoying complaints for now as they are   harmless.  And they indeed ignored it. Even though those errors are harmless, it doesn't look good in my output console when I receive bunch of them. Example of what I get:  Cannot find name 'describe'. Cannot find name 'it'. Cannot find name 'expect'.  What can I do to fix it?
I recently came across a syntax I never seen before when I learned python nor in most tutorials, the  notation, it looks something like this:  I figured it was exactly the same as (except it's longer, of course):  But my questions are:   How can it do that?   What does it actually mean with the two dots?  How can you use it in a more complex statement (if possible)?   This will probably save me many lines of code in the future...:)

If I am passing an object to a method, why should I use the ref keyword? Isn't this the default behaviour anyway? For example:  The output is "Bar" which means that the object was passed as a reference.
What is the use of the  keyword in Python? What does it do? For example, I'm trying to understand this code1:  And this is the caller:  What happens when the method  is called? Is a list returned? A single element? Is it called again? When will subsequent calls stop?   1. The code comes from Jochen Schulz (jrschulz), who made a great Python library for metric spaces. This is the link to the complete source: Module mspace.
I often find myself in a situation where I am facing multiple compilation/linker errors in a C++ project due to some bad design decisions (made by someone else :) ) which lead to circular dependencies between C++ classes in different header files (can happen also in the same file). But fortunately(?) this doesn't happen often enough for me to remember the solution to this problem for the next time it happens again. So for the purposes of easy recall in the future I am going to post a representative problem and a solution along with it. Better solutions are of-course welcome.
I'm starting to code in various projects using Python (including Django web development and Panda3D game development).  To help me understand what's going on, I would like to basically 'look' inside the Python objects to see how they tick - like their methods and properties.  So say I have a Python object, what would I need to print out its contents? Is that even possible?
How do I pass a value from one screen to its previous screen? Consider this case: I have two activities. The first screen has one  and a button and the second activity has one  and a button.  If I click the first button then it has to move to second activity and here user has to type something in the text box. If he presses the button from the second screen then the values from the text box should move to the first activity and that should be displayed in the first activity .

During Hibernate session I am loading some objects and some of them are loaded as proxies due to lazy loading. It's all OK and I don't want to turn lazy loading off. But later I need to send some of the objects (actually one object) to the GWT client via RPC. And it happens that this concrete object is a proxy. So I need to turn it to real object. I can't find a method like "materialize" in Hibernate. How can I turn some of the objects from proxies to reals knowing their class and ID? At the moment the only solution I see is to evict that object from Hibernate's cache and reload it, but it is really bad for many reasons.
I'm beginning to understand how the  keyword is used in so-called "existential types" like this:  This is only a subset, however, of how  is used and I simply cannot wrap my mind around its use in things like this:  Or explaining why these are different:  Or the whole  stuff... I tend to prefer clear, jargon-free English rather than the kinds of language which are normal in academic environments.  Most of the explanations I attempt to read on this (the ones I can find through search engines) have these problems:  They're incomplete.  They explain one part of the use of this keyword (like "existential types") which makes me feel happy until I read code that uses it in a completely different way (like ,  and  above). They're densely packed with assumptions that I've read the latest in whatever branch of discrete math, category theory or abstract algebra is popular this week.  (If I never read the words "consult the paper whatever for details of implementation" again, it will be too soon.) They're written in ways that frequently turn even simple concepts into tortuously twisted and fractured grammar and semantics.  So... On to the actual question.  Can anybody completely explain the  keyword in clear, plain English (or, if it exists somewhere, point to such a clear explanation which I've missed) that doesn't assume I'm a mathematician steeped in the jargon?  Edited to add: There were two stand-out answers from the higher-quality ones below, but unfortunately I can only choose one as best.  Norman's answer was detailed and useful, explaining things in a way that showed some of the theoretical underpinnings of  and at the same time showing me some of the practical implications of it.  yairchu's answer covered an area nobody else mentioned (scoped type variables) and illustrated all of the concepts with code and a GHCi session.  Were it possible to select both as best, I would.  Unfortunately I can't and, after looking over both answers closely, I've decided that yairchu's slightly edges out Norman's because of the illustrative code and attached explanation.  This is a bit unfair, however, because really I needed both answers to understand this to the point that  doesn't leave me with a faint sense of dread when I see it in a type signature.
I've defined a  class which (ultimately) inherits from . I want to get a list of all the fields defined for this model. For example, . Basically, I want to retrieve anything that inherits from the  class. I thought I'd be able to retrieve these by taking advantage of , but the list it returns doesn't contain any of these fields. It looks like Django has already gotten a hold of the class and added all its magic attributes and stripped out what's actually been defined. So... how can I get these fields? They probably have a function for retrieving them for their own internal purposes?

I've been programming in Java for several years now, but I just recently returned to school to get a formal degree. I was quite surprised to learn that, on my last assignment, I lost points for using a loop like the one below.  Now for my test I'm just scanning for some console input, but I was told that this kind of loop is discouraged because using  is akin to , we just don't do it. I understand fully the pitfalls of  and its Java cousin , and I have the good sense not to use them. I also realize that a more complete program would provide some other means of escape, say for instance to just end the program, but that wasn't a reason my professor cited, so... What's wrong with ?
How do prepared statements help us prevent SQL injection attacks? Wikipedia says:  Prepared statements are resilient against SQL injection, because   parameter values, which are transmitted later using a different   protocol, need not be correctly escaped. If the original statement   template is not derived from external input, SQL injection cannot   occur.  I cannot see the reason very well. What would be a simple explanation in easy English and some examples?

From MSDN's entry on Dictionary.TryGetValue Method:  This method combines the functionality of the ContainsKey method and   the Item property. If the key is not found, then the value parameter gets the appropriate   default value for the value type TValue; for example, 0 (zero) for   integer types, false for Boolean types, and null for reference types. Use the TryGetValue method if your code frequently attempts to access   keys that are not in the dictionary. Using this method is more   efficient than catching the KeyNotFoundException thrown by the Item   property. This method approaches an O(1) operation.  From the description, it's not clear if it is more efficient or just more convenient than calling ContainsKey and then doing the lookup. Does the implementation of  just call ContainsKey and then Item or is actually more efficient than that by doing a single lookup? In other words, what is more efficient (i.e. which one performs less lookups):  or  Note: I am not looking for a benchmark!
The app I'm currently building has the requirement that the app has to prevent the OS to take a screenshot of the app when it's being pushed into the background for security reasons. This way it won't be able to see the last active screen when switching between apps. I'm planning to put this functionality in the application class's onPause method, but first I need to find out how I can achieve this functionality. So is there anybody out there, that has a clue how to fix this?
If you change a dropdown and refresh the page, Firefox seems to ignore the selected attribute.  It will in fact select the option you had previously selected (before the refresh).  This ends up being a problem for me since there is an event triggered on the dropdown which changes other things.  Is there a way to make firefox stop this behavior (other than firing another event when the page loads)?

So, I started learning to code in Python and later Django. The first times it was hard looking at tracebacks and actually figure out what I did wrong and where the syntax error was. Some time has passed now and some way along the way, I guess I got a routine in debugging my Django code. As this was done early in my coding experience, I sat down and wondered if how I was doing this was ineffective and could be done faster. I usually manage to find and correct the bugs in my code, but I wonder if I should be doing it faster? I usually just use the debug info Django gives when enabled. When things do end up as I thought it would, I break the code flow a lot with a syntax error, and look at the variables at that point in the flow to figure out, where the code does something other than what I wanted. But can this be improved? Are there some good tools or better ways to debug your Django code?

I wonder if I should use the CAS protocol or OAuth + some authentication provider for single sign-on. Example Scenario:  A User tries to access a protected resource, but is not authenticated. The application redirects the user to the SSO server. If beeing authenticated the user gets a token from the SSO server. The SSO redirects to the original application. The original application checks the token against the SSO server. If the token is ok, access will be allowed and the application knows of the user id. The user performs a log-out and is logged out from all connected application at the same time (single sign-out).  As far as I understand that is exactly what was CAS invented for. CAS clients have to implement the CAS protocol to use the authentication service. Now I'm wondering about to use CAS or OAuth at the client (consumer) site. Is OAuth a replacement for that part of CAS? Should OAuth as a new de-facto standard be preferred? Is there an easy to use (not Sun OpenSSO!) replacement for the authentication part of CAS supporting different methods like username/password, OpenID, TLS certifactes ...? Context:  Different applications should rely on the authentication of the SSO server and should use something session-like. The applications can be GUI web applications or (REST) serivces. The SSO server must be provide a user id, which is necessary to get more information about the user like roles, email and so on from a central user information store. Single Sign-out should be possible. Most clients are written in Java or PHP.  I've just discovered WRAP, which could become the OAuth successor. It is a new protocol specified by Microsoft, Google and Yahoo. Addendum I've learned that OAuth was not designed for authentication even it could be used to implement SSO, but only together with a SSO service like OpenID. OpenID seems to me to be the "new CAS". CAS has some features OpenID misses (like single sign-out), but it should not be to hard to add the missing parts in a particular scenario. I think OpenID has broad acceptance and it is better to integrate OpenID into applications or application servers. I know that CAS also supports OpenID, but I think CAS is dispensable with OpenID.

I am trying to alter a table which has no primary key nor auto_increment column. I know how to add an primary key column but I was wondering if it's possible to insert data into the primary key column automatically (I already have 500 rows in DB and want to give them id but I don't want to do it manually). Any thoughts? Thanks a lot.

I have just installed XAMPP on my Windows XP machine, and I get an error saying:  Connection for controluser as defined in your configuration failed.  Before I installed XAMPP, I had a MySQL database installed and it had a password. I changed and put the password in config.inc.php for MySQL, and I got this error:   When I try to access index.php, it seems like something is wrong with the XAMPP installation.  What can I do to fix this problem?

Try-catch is meant to help in the exception handling. This means somehow that it will help our system to be more robust: try to recover from an unexpected event.  We suspect something might happen when executing and instruction (sending a message), so it gets enclosed in the try. If that something nearly unexpected happens, we can do something: we write the catch. I don't think we called to just log the exception. I thing the catch block is meant to give us the opportunity of recovering from the error. Now, let's say we recover from the error because we could fix what was wrong. It could be super nice to do a re-try:  This would quickly fall in the eternal loop, but let's say that the fix_the_problem returns true, then we retry. Given that there is no such thing in Java, how would YOU solve this problem? What would be your best design code for solving this? This is like a philosophical question, given that I already know what I'm asking for is not directly supported by Java.

I have written a Java server application that runs on a standard virtual hosted Linux solution.  The application runs all the time listening for socket connections and creating new handlers for them.  It is a server side implementation to a client-server application. The way I start it is by including it in the start up rc.local script of the server.  However once started I do not know how to access it to stop it and if I want to install an update, so I have to restart the server in order to restart the application. On a windows PC, for this type of application I might create a windows service and then I can stop and start it as I want.  Is there anything like that on a Linux box so that if I start this application I can stop it and restart it without doing a complete restart of the server. My application is called WebServer.exe.  It is started on server startup by including it in my rc.local as such:  I am a bit of a noob at Linux so any example would be appreciated with any posts.   However I do have SSH, and full FTP access to the box to install any updates as well as access to a Plesk panel.

From the doc,   Modes 'r+', 'w+' and 'a+' open the file for updating (note that 'w+' truncates the file). Append 'b' to the mode to open the file in binary mode, on systems that differentiate between binary and text files; on systems that don’t have this distinction, adding the 'b' has no effect.  and here  w+ :  Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.  But, how to read a file open with ?
I created a local branch which I want to 'push' upstream. There is a similar question here on Stack Overflow on how to track a newly created remote branch.  However, my workflow is slightly different. First I want to create a local branch, and I will only push it upstream when I'm satisfied and want to share my branch.  How would I do that? (my google searches did not seem to come up with anything). How would I tell my colleagues to pull it from the upstream repository?

I recently "upgraded" from OSX Mountain Lion to Yosemite and from R 3.1.3 to 3.2. Immediately after the upgrade, when I opened R or RStudio I got a pop-up message saying that I needed to install Java 6. In addition, loading  or any package that depends on rJava (e.g., ) caused RStudio to crash (R also crashed when I tried this by opening  directly).  After trying a few fixes found on Stack Overflow and elsewhere (more details below), I am at a point where loading  or any package that depends on  no longer causes R to crash, but results in the following error:  However, if I invoke R from the command line and then load  or any package that depends on , it seems to work (or at least I don't get any error messages). I've tried a number of different attempted fixes, some of them a few times, and can't quite remember exactly what I did in what order (didn't realize this would be such a morass and wasn't really keeping track), but here's the gist of it:  Added the following to my  (per this SO answer):  export JAVA_HOME="/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8"   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/server  Reconfigured java from the command line as follows:  sudo R CMD javareconf -n    Checked  and discovered this was set to  . I tried setting it to the following (per this SO question):  options("java.home"="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/jre")  Installed the latest Java Development Kit and reinstalled  from source (can't remember where I found that one).  At some point while trying all of these, I was able to load  without crashing R, but instead got the error message posted above. In addition, when I quit RStudio, it would seem to close normally, but then an "RStudio quit unexpectedly" message would pop up, indicating that the program had crashed while trying to close.  I finally decided to install Java for OS X 2014-001 (Java 6), as I seemed to be running out of options. Now, when I opened R or RStudio the "This software needs Java 6" pop-up message no longer appeared. However, I was still getting the  error message posted above.  In reviewing some of the posts I'd already looked at, I noticed another SO answer that I'd missed before, which recommended opening RStudio with the following command line code that gives RStudio the correct path to java:  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server: open -a RStudio  That opened an RStudio window and I was also able to load  and packages that depend on it without getting an error. Lastly, I tried running R from the command line (which I hadn't done before). It turns out that on the command line, loading  or any package that depends on  works and does not throw any errors. So, I can now get  to work if I open RStudio from the command line with the code that gives RStudio the java path (as noted above). However, I'd like to find a way to fix the underlying problem, whatever it may be, so that RStudio can be opened in the usual Mac way, without needing a command line kludge. I'm also concerned that having an old version of Java installed could cause problems down the road.  Does anyone have any ideas about how to diagnose and solve this issue?

I know there are lots of questions similiar to this one, but i couldn't find a solution for my problem in any of those. Besides, I'll provide details for my specific case. I coded an Ionic project in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and now I have to build it for release. So I run the command:  And I'm shown the following error:   I don't have this  directory. My Android Studio is 2.3, the latest version for now Android SDK Platform-Tools 25.0.3 Android SDK Tools 25.3.1 All Android versions from 2.1 (Eclair) to 7.1.1 (Nougat)  After extensive research, I put all the Android Studio-related environment variables in the file . So now it looks like this:  Now, for the sake of testing the environment variables, I run the following commands:  And all the path variables are correctly displayed. So, it looks like the environment variables are like they should be according to the various similar questions and in tutorials i've searched. Does anyone know what am I doing wrong? Why do I still get the Gradle Wrapper error?
What is the best way to go about calling a function given a string with the function's name in a Python program.  For example, let's say that I have a module , and I have a string whose contents are . What is the best way to go about calling ? I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don't just use . I figured out how to do it by using  to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I'm hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.

I've got a very weird bug on our test machine. The error is:  I just can't understand why.  is there in the  class, and I've even recompiled a version with writes to the event log just to make sure that it's not a deployment/versioning issue.  The weird thing is that the calling code doesn't even call the  method.
Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:  Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: . The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):  A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it "a dramatic design flaw" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?) Edit:  Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:  To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or "together" with it? Doing the binding inside the function would mean that  is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the  line would be "hybrid" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time. The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.
I have the following table:  I don't want there to ever be more than one column for any given / pair.

Is there any way to add a  constraint at this point?

I would like to set up rules in IIS7 for static content caching in my ASP.NET website. I have seen these articles, which details how to do it using the  element in :  Client Cache  (IIS.NET) Add Expires or Cache Control Header to static content in IIS (Stack Overflow)  However, this setting appears to apply globally to all static content. Is there a way to do this just for certain directories or extensions? For example, I may have two directories which need separate cache settings:     Is it possible to set up rules for sending cache headers (, , etc) based on extensions and folder paths? Please note, I must be able to do this via  because I don't have access to the IIS console.
I have the feeling that I'm missing the obvious, but have not succeeded with  or google ("http" makes such a bad search term). I'm looking for a quick&dirty fix to one of our webservers that frequently fails, returning status code 500 with an error message. Once this happens, it needs to be restarted. As the root cause seems to be hard to find, we're aiming for a quick fix, hoping that it will be enough to bridge the time until we can really fix it (the service doesn't need high availability) The proposed solution is to create a cron job that runs every 5 minutes, checking http://localhost:8080/. If this returns with status code 500, the webserver will be restarted. The server will restart in under a minute, so there's no need to check for restarts already running. The server in question is a ubuntu 8.04 minimal installation with just enough packages installed to run what it currently needs. There is no hard requirement to do the task in bash, but I'd like it to run in such a minimal environment without installing any more interpreters.  (I'm sufficiently familiar with scripting that the command/options to assign the http status code to an environment variable would be enough - this is what I've looked for and could not find.)
In my bash script I have an external (received from user) string, which I should use in sed pattern.  How can I escape the  string so it would be safely accepted by  as a literal replacement? NOTE: The  is a dumb substring with no matches etc. It is not supplied by user.
I want to setup a click event trigger in jQuery for certain anchor tags.

I use an  for loading operations that I implemented as an inner class.  In  I show a loading dialog which I then hide again in . But for some of the loading operations I know in advance that they will finish very quickly so I don't want to display the loading dialog.  I wanted to indicate this by a boolean parameter that I could pass to  but apparently for some reason  doesn't take any parameters. The obvious workaround would probably be to create a member field in my AsyncTask or in the outer class which I would have to set before every loading operation but that does not seem very elegant. Is there a better way to do this?

At the risk of stepping into holy war territory, What are the strengths and weaknesses of these popular DI/IoC frameworks, and could one easily be considered the best? ..:  Ninject Unity  Castle.Windsor Autofac StructureMap   Are there any other DI/IoC Frameworks for C# that I haven't listed here? In context of my use case, I'm building a client WPF app, and a WCF/SQL services infrastructure, ease of use (especially in terms of clear and concise syntax), consistent documentation, good community support and performance are all important factors in my choice. Update: The resources and duplicate questions cited appear to be out of date, can someone with knowledge of all these frameworks come forward and provide some real insight? I realise that most opinion on this subject is likely to be biased, but I am hoping that someone has taken the time to study all these frameworks and have at least a generally objective comparison. I am quite willing to make my own investigations if this hasn't been done before, but I assumed this was something at least a few people had done already. Second Update: If you do have experience with more than one DI/IoC container, please rank and summarise the pros and cons of those, thank you. This isn't an exercise in discovering all the obscure little containers that people have made, I'm looking for comparisons between the popular (and active) frameworks.

Really silly problem here.  In Visual Studio 2010, the text cursor has changed from the blinking line, to a blinking grey box around the characters. When I type overwrites the text in front of it.  I'm not sure how to get this off? It's like what happens when you press the insert key in microsoft word and overwrite mode gets turned on. I'm working on a mac with a windows virtual machine so when I hit insert it's just a shortcut key for Parallels (the Virtual Machine program I'm running). Would appreciate any help!!

I'm trying to locate and replace all numbers in a body of text.  I've found a few example regex's, which almost solve the problem, but none are perfect yet.  The problem I have is that the numbers in my text may or may not have decimals and commas.  For example:  "The 5000 lb. fox jumped over a 99,999.99998713 foot fence."   The regex should return "" and "".  Examples I've found break-up the numbers on the comma or are limited to two decimal places.  I'm starting to understand regex's enough to see why some examples are limited to two decimal places, but I haven't yet learned how to overcome it and also include the comma to get the entire sequence. Here is my latest version:   Which returns, "", "", "", and "" for the above text.
Let's just suppose I have a valid need for directly executing a sql command in Entity Framework. I am having trouble figuring out how to use parameters in my sql statement. The following example (not my real example) doesn't work.

How do I specify the parameters correctly?

I have an application that deals with clients from all over the world, and, naturally, I want everything going into my databases to be UTF-8 encoded.  The main problem for me is that I don't know what encoding the source of any string is going to be - it could be from a text box (using  is only useful if the user is actually submitted the form), or it could be from an uploaded text file, so I really have no control over the input. What I need is a function or class that makes sure the stuff going into my database is, as far as is possible, UTF-8 encoded. I've tried  but that has problems (if the input is 'fiancée' it returns 'fianc'). I've tried a lot of things =/ For file uploads, I like the idea of asking the end user to specify the encoding they use, and show them previews of what the output will look like, but this doesn't help against nasty hackers (in fact, it could make their life a little easier). I've read the other SO questions on the subject, but they seem to all have subtle differences like "I need to parse RSS feeds" or "I scrape data from websites" (or, indeed, "You can't").  But there must be something that at least has a good try!
Is there any significant difference between between the two python keywords  and  like in the examples  and  I should be aware of?

I did change the datadir of a MySQL installation and following some steps it worked fine. Every base I had was moved correctly but one. I can connect and USE the database, even SHOW TABLES returns me all the tables correctly and the files of each table exists on the mysql data directory. But when I try to SELECT something there, it says the table doesn't exists. But the table does exists, it even shows at SHOW TABLES statement! My guess is that the SHOW TABLES lists the files existence somehow that the files are corrupt or something like that but it doesn't check it. So I can list them but not access them. But that's just a guess, I've never seen this before. Can't restart the database now for testing, every other application which uses it is running fine. Does anyone knows what is it? Example:
In the remote server I have a post-receive hook set up in order to make a git checkout of my repository:  But when I make a push from my local machine to the git repository in the server, I get the following error messages:  This appears many times over, one error message for almost every file. However I have a README.txt file that I'm able to change using git, here are its permissions:  But other files with exactly the same owner and same permissions, give me that error. In another local repository for another website, I have the files with my local machine username as owner, and when I push to the remote server it respects the remote server owner of the files and works like a charm. Obviously it seems a permissions related error, but I can't find a way to fix it, any suggestions?

I attempted to use the  value to name the inputs, but despite the string literals in HTML appearing correct, it is now working. Here is my code as of now:  I have tried removing the  from index, but that does not work either. As of now, the validation property of the input is working correctly, but the error message is not displayed. Anyone have any suggestions? Edit: In addition to the great answers below, here is a blog article that covers this issue in more detail: http://www.thebhwgroup.com/blog/2014/08/angularjs-html-form-design-part-2/
Is there a way to return the difference between two arrays in JavaScript? For example:  Any advice greatly appreciated.
How do I perform the SQL Join equivalent in MongoDB? For example say you have two collections (users and comments) and I want to pull all the comments with pid=444 along with the user info for each.   Is there a way to pull all the comments with a certain field (eg. ...find({pid:444}) ) and the user information associated with each comment in one go? At the moment, I am first getting the comments which match my criteria, then figuring out all the uid's in that result set, getting the user objects, and merging them with the comment's results. Seems like I am doing it wrong.
I keep rereading the Docker documentation to try to understand the difference between Docker and a full VM. How does it manage to provide a full filesystem, isolated networking environment, etc. without being as heavy? Why is deploying software to a docker image (if that's the right term) easier than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?
I know there are lots of questions similiar to this one, but i couldn't find a solution for my problem in any of those. Besides, I'll provide details for my specific case. I coded an Ionic project in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and now I have to build it for release. So I run the command:  And I'm shown the following error:   I don't have this  directory. My Android Studio is 2.3, the latest version for now Android SDK Platform-Tools 25.0.3 Android SDK Tools 25.3.1 All Android versions from 2.1 (Eclair) to 7.1.1 (Nougat)  After extensive research, I put all the Android Studio-related environment variables in the file . So now it looks like this:  Now, for the sake of testing the environment variables, I run the following commands:  And all the path variables are correctly displayed. So, it looks like the environment variables are like they should be according to the various similar questions and in tutorials i've searched. Does anyone know what am I doing wrong? Why do I still get the Gradle Wrapper error?
In Perl, what is a good way to perform a replacement on a string using a regular expression and store the value in a different variable, without changing the original? I usually just copy the string to a new variable then bind it to the  regex that does the replacement on the new string, but I was wondering if there is a better way to do this?

I was going to ask a question about preparing a desktop application to support multiple languages on the UI.   In my search for existing questions on the topic I was thinking the word "International", so I selected the Internationalization tag and read through some matching questions. Eventually I realized I should probably be looking under questions tagged Localization instead.  However it appears I'm not alone in getting these two terms mixed up. So, what are they key differences between Localization and Internationalization?   Also, is a clear distinction between them really that important?

I work with multiple projects and I want to recursively delete all folders with the name 'bin' or 'obj'.  That way, I am sure that all projects will rebuild everyhing (sometimes it's the only way to force visual studio to forget all about previous builds).  Is there a quick way to accomplish this (with a bat file for example) without having to write a .net program?
I am trying to explain to a non-developer the difference between an API an SDK. I need to explain why a commercial fingerprint software vendor will likely not provide an SDK, although they may certainly have used one. Both device vendors and software vendors can and should expose a well-defined API. This API allows other software programs to (be written to) inter-operate with the vendor’s own software components or hardware devices. If someone has more ideas to explain this clearly, I would very much appreciate the suggestions. I want to emphasize that the goal is to explain the concepts to a non-programmer who does not know developer lingo. Specifically, in the context of a fingerprint sensor versus software to do enrollment/verification, here is how I attempted to explain it:  If I am a fingerprint device/sensor manufacturer and not in the   business of writing software, the ways I could better market my   product are:  Make sure my device drivers are installable on a wide variety of operating systems Define and provide an API for software developers to write programs (e.g., for enrollment, verification) to “talk” to or use my   device Develop and provide an SDK (one step beyond an API) to make it easier and faster for software developers to write programs that work   with my device. SDKs may provide helper code libraries, reference   applications, documentation etc.

We are unable to connect to an HTTPS server using  because of this error message:  We know that the server doesn't have a valid HTTPS certificate with the path used, but to bypass this issue, we use the following code that we've taken from another StackOverflow post:  The problem is that server never validates the certificate and fails with the above error. Does anyone have any idea of what should I do?  I should mention that a colleague and I performed tests a few weeks ago and it was working fine with something similar to what I wrote above.

I was trying to normalize a set of numbers from -100 to 0 to a range of 10-100 and was having problems only to notice that even with no variables at all, this does not evaluate the way I would expect it to:  Float division doesn't work either:  If either side of the division is cast to a float it will work:  Each side in the first example is evaluating as an int which means the final answer will be cast to an int. Since 0.111 is less than .5, it rounds to 0.  It is not transparent in my opinion, but I guess that's the way it is. What is the explanation?

I need the following function: Input: a  Output:    if all elements in the input list evaluate as equal to each other using the standard equality operator;   otherwise.  Performance: of course, I prefer not to incur any unnecessary overhead. I feel it would be best to:   iterate through the list  compare adjacent elements and  all the resulting Boolean values  But I'm not sure what's the most Pythonic way to do that.  EDIT: Thank you for all the great answers. I rated up several, and it was really hard to choose between @KennyTM and @Ivo van der Wijk solutions. The lack of short-circuit feature only hurts on a long input (over ~50 elements) that have unequal elements early on. If this occurs often enough (how often depends on how long the lists might be), the short-circuit is required. The best short-circuit algorithm seems to be @KennyTM . It pays, however, a significant cost for this:  up to 20x in performance nearly-identical lists up to 2.5x in performance on short lists  If the long inputs with early unequal elements don't happen (or happen sufficiently rarely), short-circuit isn't required. Then, by far the fastest is @Ivo van der Wijk solution.

I came across the term duck typing while reading random topics on software online and did not completely understand it. What is “duck typing”?
I wrote the two methods below to automatically select N distinct colors. It works by defining a piecewise linear function on the RGB cube. The benefit of this is you can also get a progressive scale if that's what you want, but when N gets large the colors can start to look similar. I can also imagine evenly subdividing the RGB cube into a lattice and then drawing points. Does anyone know any other methods? I'm ruling out defining a list and then just cycling through it. I should also say I don't generally care if they clash or don't look nice, they just have to be visually distinct.

I'm trying to update the length of a varchar column from 255 characters to 500 without losing the contents.

I found the documentation here: ALTER TABLE (Transfact-SQL) however I can't make heads or tails of it. I have the following so far (essentially nothing unfortunately):  How do I approach this? Is there better documentation for this statement out there (I did some searches for an example statement but came up empty)?

I could iterate through the list and add all values that aren't duplicates to another list of strings, but this seems dirty and inefficient.  I have a feeling there's some magical Linq construction that'll do this in one line, but I haven't been able to come up with anything.

I kind of want to do this: URL request:  In the request body:  Before you get mad at me for making up my own HTTP method, help me out and give me a better idea on how I should invoke a server-side method in a RESTful way. :) EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION Some more clarification around what the "bark" method does. Here are some options that may result in differently structured API calls:  bark just sends an email to dog.email and records nothing. bark sends an email to dog.email and the increments dog.barkCount by 1. bark creates a new "bark" record with bark.timestamp recording when the bark occured. It also increments dog.barkCount by 1. bark runs a system command to pull the latest version of the dog code down from Github. It then sends a text message to dog.owner telling them that the new dog code is in production.
I am trying to create a custom filter in AngularJS that will filter a list of objects by the values of a specific property. In this case, I want to filter by the "polarity" property(possible values of "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative").  Here is my working code without the filter: HTML:   Here is the "$scope.tweets" array in JSON format:  The best filter I could come up with as follows:  This method returns an empty array. And nothing is printed from the "console.log(polarity)" statement. It seems like I am not inserting the correct parameters to access the object property of "polarity."  Any ideas? Your response is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so we can now submit video previews of our apps on the App Store. According to Apple we should do so with an iOS8 device and  The problem is you have to have all the different devices (4", 4.7", 5.5" and iPad).  Is there an alternative to this? I am thinking of capturing a video of the simulator. The problem is the device screen is bigger than my  monitor when shown in 100% resolution. Any solution that can capture a video right from the simulator in full resolution? Edit: Since a lot of people are answering questions I'm not asking let me say:  - Recording one device size and scaling it is not what I'm asking;  - How to record any app preview is not what I'm asking; - How you do your previews is not what I'm asking; What I am asking is can you record a video from the simulator in 100% resolution if it doesn't fit on the screen?

I have seen this mentioned a few times and I am not clear on what it means. When and why would you do this?  I know what interfaces do, but the fact I am not clear on this makes me think I am missing out on using them correctly.  Is it just so if you were to do:  You could use any class that implements ? When would you need to do that? The only thing I can think of is if you have a method and you are unsure of what object will be passed expect for it implementing . I cannot think how often you would need to do that... (Also, how could you write a method that takes in an object that implements an interface? Is that possible?) Sorry if I completely missed the point.
I like how Java has a Map where you can define the types of each entry in the map, for example .  What I'm looking for is a type of collection where each element in the collection is a pair of values.  Each value in the pair can have its own type (like the String and Integer example above), which is defined at declaration time.   The collection will maintain its given order and will not treat one of the values as a unique key (as in a map).   Essentially I want to be able to define an ARRAY of type  or any other 2 types.   I realize that I can make a class with nothing but the 2 variables in it, but that seems overly verbose.   I also realize that I could use a 2D array, but because of the different types I need to use, I'd have to make them arrays of OBJECT, and then I'd have to cast all the time.   I only need to store pairs in the collection, so I only need two values per entry.  Does something like this exist without going the class route?  Thanks!

I have a node.js project that contains some Jasmine specifications. The specifications are in a spec/ subdirectory and have the .spec.coffee extension, as required by jasmine-node. When I open one of my spec files in the WebStorm IDE, all the calls to  and  and  are shown with blue squiggly underlines with the tooltip: "Unresolved function or method it()". So even though I'm using the 3.0 EAP and it's supposed to have some amount of Jasmine support, it's not automatically picking up on the fact that this is a Jasmine spec file. I tried going into File > Settings > JavaScript Libraries, and adding Jasmine as a library (specifying the path to jasmine-2.0.0.rc1.js), and then going to the Usage Scope sub-page and checking "Jasmine" in the drop-down list next to "Project", but that had no effect -- the Jasmine methods still show up as unresolved.

However, I occasionally get this:  I'm not surprised that the method sometimes throws, but I'm surprised to get this particular message when recursive is true.  (I know the directory is not empty.) Is there a reason I'd see this instead of AccessViolationException?
It is my understanding that the  package does not have support for named groups (http://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html) so can anyone point me towards a third-party library that does?

How do I get the collection of errors in a view? I don't want to use the Html Helper Validation Summary or Validation Message. Instead I want to check for errors and if any display them in specific format. Also on the input controls I want to check for a specific property error and add a class to the input.  P.S. I'm using the Spark View Engine but the idea should be the same. So I figured I could do something like...  Or something like that. UPDATE My final solution looked like this:  This only adds the error css class if this property has an error.

What is the best way to simulate a user entering text in a text input box in JS and/or jQuery? I dont want to actually put text in the input box, I just want to trigger all the event handlers that would normally get triggered by a user typing info into a input box. This means focus, keydown, keypress, keyup, and blur. I think.  So how would one accomplish this?
Every time a user posts something containing  or  in a page in my web application, I get this exception thrown. I don't want to go into the discussion about the smartness of throwing an exception or crashing an entire web application because somebody entered a character in a text box, but I am looking for an elegant way to handle this. Trapping the exception and showing  An error has occurred please go back and re-type your entire form again, but this time please do not use <  doesn't seem professional enough to me. Disabling post validation () will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks. Ideally: When a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded. So the  property of my text-box will be  Is there a way I can do this from a handler?

The obvious attempt:  does not work, because  does not implement a []-indexer. I just wonder if there is any similar class? I thought about using a Stack, but that only stores a string. I could now create my own struct and then use a , but I wonder if there is another alternative, essentially a Dictionary that implements an []-indexer on the Keys?
I have a coworker who is actively trying to convince me that I should not use do..end and instead use curly braces for defining multiline blocks in Ruby.

So which is it, and why? (Example of some shoulda code)  or  Personally, just looking at the above answers the question for me, but I wanted to open this up to the greater community.
I want to get  gesture detection working in my Android application. What I have is a  that contains 9 s. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout. That file I take is from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted. For the simple click situation I need only set the  for each  I add to be the main  which implements . It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a . I presume this is because it may span ?  If my activity implements  I don't know how to set that as the gesture listener for the  or the  views that I add.  If my activity implements  then I have no  method to  (it has two events as parameters allowing me to determine if the fling was noteworthy).  If I make a custom , like  that extends  I don't know how to tell the activity that a  has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.  I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this ? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.  Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings? If I choose not to  my child image views from XML can I pass the  as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of  that I create? This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the  detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream). I've been looking at these sources:  Detect Gestures - Tutorial SDK docs Calculator Code  Nothing has worked for me so far and I was hoping for some pointers.
I'm new to REST and I've observed that in some RESTful services they use different resource URI for update/get/delete and Create. Such as  Create - using /resources with POST method (observe plural) at some places using /resource (singular) Update - using /resource/123 with PUT method Get - Using /resource/123 with GET method  I'm little bit confused about this URI naming convention. What should we use plural or singular for resource creation? What should be the criteria while deciding that?

Given I have a HUGE array, and a value from it. I want to get index of the value in array. Is there any other way, rather then call  to get it? The problem comes from the need of keeping really huge array and calling  enormous amount of times. After a couple of tries I found that caching indexes inside elements by storing structs with  fields instead of the value itself gives a huge step in performance (20x times win). Still I wonder if there's a more convenient way of finding index of en element without caching (or there's a good caching technique that will boost up the performance).

Now that Facebook has depreciated the landing pages for apps, how do I get my app to point to the Fan page for it's landing page? I've checked under the Advanced tab and contacts -- but there's no place I can see to list my Fan page as being linked to my application. According to this blog post from December, new apps can create a new Fan page, but there's no information on how to do it for existing pages -- they just say that "it will be linked automatically."  Unfortunately it was not -- when you post something from our app onto your wall, the link takes you to our website rather than our Fan page. I'd love for that link to take you to our fanpage again, but I seemingly can't find any documentation on this.

Is there an easy way (aka: not using a proxy) to get access to the raw request/response XML for a webservice published with JAX-WS reference implementation (the one included in JDK 1.5 and better) ? Being able to do that via code is what I need to do. Just having it logged to a file by clever logging configurations would be nice but enough. I know that other more complex and complete frameworks exist that might do that, but I would like to keep it as simple as possible and axis, cxf, etc all add considerable overhead that I want to avoid. Thanks!
I'm using TFS Preview (Team Foundation Service, https://tfspreview.com/) with one of my projects with Visual Studio 2012. I'm also using an on-premises TFS server with most of my projects. When I use my on-premises TFS after using TFS preview and go back to using TFS preview, I get this error:  TF30063: You are not authorized to access MyProject\DefaultCollection.  If I go to Team -> Disconnect TFS and then connect to TFS preview again, I'm able to see a "Loading identifiers" loading screen coming up, but in the end I don't get to enter my credentials to TFS preview (my Microsoft account) and as a result, the TF30063 error still occurs. I suspect this has something to do with my Microsoft Account (i.e. Live ID). I'm logged in to Windows with the same MS Account that I use at TFS preview. I have logged in to other sites (Windows Development Center, MSDN, etc) with other MS accounts, but I verified that if I log out of these services and re-login with the correct MS account, I still get the TF30063 error when I try to log in to TFS preview from Visual Studio.
I am looking for an equivalent in Chrome to the "break on all errors" functionality of Firebug.

I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a  value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer).  I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt() function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by restricting yourself to integer-only domain.  Maintaining a lookup table is impratical (since there are about 231.5 integers whose square is less than 263). Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:   Notes: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.  Update 2:  A new solution posted by A. Rex has proven to be even faster.  In a run over the first 1 billion integers, the solution only required 34% of the time that the original solution used.  While the John Carmack hack is a little better for small values of n, the benefit compared to this solution is pretty small. Here is the A. Rex solution, converted to Java:   Update:  I've tried the different solutions presented below.  After exhaustive testing, I found that adding  to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine. The John Carmack hack was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the Carmack hack for n < 410881. Newton's method was a good bit slower than .  This is probably because  uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles. A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than . Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.  The one suggestion which did show improvements was made by John D. Cook.  You can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9.  This means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares.  Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime. Working from John's suggestion, I investigated properties of the last n bits of a perfect square.  By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits.  This means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math.  Implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm).  Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical. Here is the code that I have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers).  For values of n less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm.  Notes:  According to John's tests, using  statements is faster in C++ than using a , but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between  and . I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or  statement, I would just say .  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower.  I'm not sure why.  This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

I've recently read about namespaces and how they are beneficial.  I'm creating a project in Laravel and was trying to move from class map autoloading to namespacing. I can't seem to grasp what the actual difference is between PSR-0 and PSR-4. Some resources that I've read from  are  Battle of the Autoloaders Laracasts PSR-4 autoloading PSR-0 PSR-4  What I understand:  PSR-4 does not convert underscores to directory separators Certain specific rules of composer cause the directory structure to become complex which in turn makes PSR-0 namespacing verbose and thus PSR-4 was created  Examples explaining the difference would be appreciated.

Let's say you don't want other sites to "frame" your site in an :  So you insert anti-framing, frame busting JavaScript into all your pages:  Excellent! Now you "bust" or break out of any containing iframe automatically. Except for one small problem. As it turns out, your frame-busting code can be busted, as shown here:  This code does the following:  increments a counter every time the browser attempts to navigate away from the current page, via the  event handler sets up a timer that fires every millisecond via , and if it sees the counter incremented, changes the current location to a server of the attacker's control that server serves up a page with HTTP status code 204, which does not cause the browser to navigate anywhere  My question is -- and this is more of a JavaScript puzzle than an actual problem -- how can you defeat the frame-busting buster?  I had a few thoughts, but nothing worked in my testing:  attempting to clear the  event via  had no effect adding an  stopped the process let the user know it was happening, but did not interfere with the code in any way; clicking OK lets the busting continue as normal I can't think of any way to clear the  timer  I'm not much of a JavaScript programmer, so here's my challenge to you: hey buster, can you bust the frame-busting buster?

I search for a good way to copy a file (binary or text). I've written several samples, everyone works. But I want hear the opinion of seasoned programmers. I missing good examples and search a way which works with C++. ANSI-C-WAY  POSIX-WAY (K&R use this in "The C programming language", more low-level)  KISS-C++-Streambuffer-WAY  COPY-ALGORITHM-C++-WAY  OWN-BUFFER-C++-WAY  LINUX-WAY // requires kernel >= 2.6.33  Environment   GNU/LINUX (Archlinux) Kernel 3.3 GLIBC-2.15, LIBSTDC++ 4.7 (GCC-LIBS), GCC 4.7, Coreutils 8.16 Using RUNLEVEL 3 (Multiuser, Network, Terminal, no GUI) INTEL SSD-Postville 80 GB, filled up to 50%   Copy a 270 MB OGG-VIDEO-FILE    Steps to reproduce   Results (CPU TIME used)   Filesize doesn't change. sha256sum print the same results. The video file is still playable.   Questions  What method would you prefer? Do you know better solutions? Do you see any mistakes in my code? Do you know a reason to avoid a solution? FSTREAM (KISS, Streambuffer) I really like this one, because it is really short and simple. As far is I know the operator << is overloaded for rdbuf() and doesn't convert anything. Correct?  Thanks Update 1 I changed the source in all samples in that way, that the open and close of the file descriptors is include in the measurement of clock(). Their are no other significant changes in the source code. The results doesn't changed! I also used time to double-check my results.   Update 2 ANSI C sample changed: The condition of the while-loop doesn't call any longer feof() instead I moved fread() into the condition. It looks like, the code runs now 10,000 clocks faster.   Measurement changed: The former results were always buffered, because I repeated the old command line rm to.ogv && sync && time ./program for each program a few times. Now I reboot the system for every program. The unbuffered results are new and show no surprise. The unbuffered results didn't changed really. If i don't delete the old copy, the programs react different. Overwriting a existing file buffered is faster with POSIX and SENDFILE, all other programs are slower. Maybe the options truncate or create have a impact on this behaviour. But overwriting existing files with the same copy is not a real world use-case.   Performing the copy with cp takes 0.44 seconds unbuffered und 0.30 seconds buffered. So cp is a little bit slower than the POSIX sample. Looks fine for me.   Maybe I add also samples and results of mmap() and  from boost::filesystem. Update 3 I've put this also on a blog page and extended it a little bit. Including splice(), which is a low-level function from the Linux kernel. Maybe more samples with Java will follow. http://www.ttyhoney.com/blog/?page_id=69

I am using npm v1.0.104/node 0.6.12 on ubuntu - I am receiving the error copied below while attempting to install any new modules via npm (I tested socket.io earlier using http, not https though & am wondering if that could have resulted in the issue with npm/unsigned certs).  The error pops up once npm tries to resolve the 'https://registry.npmjs.org' URL.  Is there anyway I can ignore the error or perhaps locate/add the cert to a trusted store in order to continue using npm.  Any insight on what needs to be done to resolve the issue will be appreciated (I would prefer to resolve the issue through configuration as opposed to re-installing if possible).

Here i have one view pager activity which has one imageview and 2 overlay bars. there overlay bars i made using android xml file layout itself. Here my requirement is like that  1) single tap on view pager's imageview first time  = show top and bottom rectangle overlaybar. 2) single tap on view pager's imageview second time = hide these overlays. These both are functions like android gallary view type. But here when these top and bottom layout bar displays at that time i want to use only buttons click only which buttons are declare within this layout. But I am not getting success to achieve this thing. Problems  1) when  is there if i can click on  button than its takes event for behind imageview single tap touch event, And my bar is getting invisible. 2) Only wants declare buttons event only 3) Avoid imageview getting clicked when i touch to overlay bar. In short when my top and bottom image bar appears at that time no touh event takes place for imageview from top and bottom image bar. I can click on imageview but not making clickable when i click on actually next or previous or share button. So these are the problems which i am facing, Please help me .

I want to delete a branch both locally and on my remote project fork on GitHub. Failed Attempts to Delete Remote Branch  What do I need to do differently to successfully delete the  branch both locally and on GitHub?
I have been running into issues with the chrome autofill behavior on several forms.  The fields in the form all have very common and accurate names, such as "email", "name", or "password", and they also have  set.  The autocomplete flag has successfully disabled the autocomplete behavior, where a dropdown of values appear as you start typing, but has not changed the values that Chrome auto-populates the fields as.  This behavior would be ok except that chrome is filling the inputs incorrectly, for example filling the phone input with an email address. Customers have complained about this, so it's verified to be happening in multiple cases, and not as some some sort of result to something that I've done locally on my machine.  The only current solution I can think of is to dynamically generate custom input names and then extract the values on the backend, but this seems like a pretty hacky way around this issue. Are there any tags or quirks that change the autofill behavior that could be used to fix this?
How do you set, clear, and toggle a bit in C/C++?
I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen. The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom. I have a header  and a content . At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so: CSS and HTML       The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required. For anything inside the content div, setting  will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with it's height set to 100%. Putting  inside  will not allow this to work. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the ? Update: Elements inside the content  will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the  will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%. Update 2: For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside  would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.
What are the pros and cons of using Criteria or HQL? The Criteria API is a nice object-oriented way to express queries in Hibernate, but sometimes Criteria Queries are more difficult to understand/build than HQL.  When do you use Criteria and when HQL? What do you prefer in which use cases? Or is it just a matter of taste?

I need to check a JavaScript array to see if there are any duplicate values. What's the easiest way to do this? I just need to find what the duplicated values are - I don't actually need their indexes or how many times they are duplicated. I know I can loop through the array and check all the other values for a match, but it seems like there should be an easier way. Any ideas? Thanks!

According to http://www.faqs.org/docs/diveintopython/fileinfo_private.html:  Like most languages, Python has the   concept of private elements:   Private   functions, which can't be called from   outside their module   However, if I define two files:  and:  when i run  it prints out  without giving any exception. Is diveintopython wrong, or did I misunderstand something? And is there some way to do define a module's function as private?
I'm using ASP.NET MVC and I'd like all user entered string fields to be trimmed before they're inserted into the database.   And since I have many data entry forms, I'm looking for an elegant way to trim all strings instead of explicitly trimming every user supplied string value.  I'm interested to know how and when people are trimming strings. I thought about perhaps creating a custom model binder and trimming any string values there...that way, all my trimming logic is contained in one place.  Is this a good approach?  Are there any code samples that do this?
According to String#intern(),  method is supposed to return the String from the String pool if the String is found in String pool, otherwise a new string object will be added in String pool and the reference of this String is returned.  So i tried this:   I was expecting that  will be printed as s3 is interned, and  will not be printed. But the result is: both lines are printed. So that means, by default String constants are interned. But if it is so, then why do we need the  method? In other words when should we use this method?
